<blockquote>
<p><span class="sc">Johnstown, Pennsylvania,</span> July 3.—This
is how it was with us as a family on the day of the Johnstown
disaster:—On the morning of the destruction, soon after breakfast, I went out and, to
my surprise, there was a mighty torrent of water running down Main Street, so heavily
had the rain fallen the previous night; and the force of the torrent continued
to grow until midday, when my brother Seth went to his wife and child at his
mother-in-law’s house on the hillside, out of all danger’s reach. I and the family—my
wife and four children—were trapped in the house by water, but without dreaming we
were in any danger, as we were in the center of town. Soon after lunch the
water came into the house, but not before we had moved all that we could upstairs and
took with us there some drinking water and a little sustenance, thinking to have supper
comfortably out of the water’s reach. The house was two-storey and made of bricks;
there were also two firm and tall brick houses on either side of mine.

<p>The children took off their shoes and the greater part of their over-clothes
and were amusing themselves in the library, the windows of which faced towards
South Fork—site of the destructive reservoir. Our view extended almost two miles
up the valley. I was reading and my wife was chatting to the children, but I noticed her
voice and movements betrayed worry and fear. Before long I told her not to worry as
we were perfectly safe, but she did not agree with my opinion, though she said not a
word. Suddenly, in an agitated but low voice, she said, “Look outside!” I looked out
and saw at once that the reservoir had broken. I had not considered its existence
previously that day and I had heard no one else even mention it.

<p>I told the family to remain calm; that half the town would drown, yet
our safety lay in being calm, in not panicking, and in trusting in God. There is hardly
need for me to point out that the fierce flood looked not like water but as if the
valley—its houses, trees, bridges, works, and all—was being swept away by a mighty
avenging angel. Every access between ourselves and the <i>garret</i> was blocked, and we
went from the library into a third room, closing every door behind us in order to keep
out all the wreckage that lay on the surface of the water, so that we might have only water,
however threatening, to contend with. There was in this room an old tall <i>book case</i>,
almost as tall as the room; and I secured it to the wall as best I could and placed the
four children on top of it, and told my wife to hang on to it, and that I would do my
best to keep it upright.

<p>By now the great wooden house of a neighbor which had stood on the
street next to ours had been thrown on top of the library room and had shattered
that room to its very foundations; at the same instant the tall strong house to the right
of us broke in half and two of its children drowned. I saw through the window—and
beyond all help—between a dozen and a score of people going under in the torrent,
the majority praying, though I heard several blaspheme. The children too could see,
and the screaming frightened them more than the water. I told them to recite the
Lord’s Prayer together, and their heavenly Father would be sure to save them; but
<span title="Roswell, age 4">Ossie</span>, the youngest, was shouting pretty tellingly
each time after the Amen—<i>“Papa,
open the window and let this water go out!”</i> The only reply he received was a loving
smile. Soon the room next to us collapsed, and then there was four feet of water in our
room. The waters calmed and I supposed the worst was over. There was a pause; but
in no time the <i>backwater</i> came rushing at us until the house shook and my wife and I
were up to our mouths in water. My wife lost heart, but I threw off my coat and held
her head above the water (she having fainted), and then <span title="Martha, age 10">our little girl</span>
shouted, “Dad,
it's gone down an inch,” pointing to the wall. It had indeed receded an inch! Within
an hour and a half there was not more than a foot and a half of water in the room.

<p>There was a wall between us and the room which fronted on Main Street.
“Would that we had an axe,” I said. “Here it is,” said <span title="David, age 6">David, our second boy</span>.
He had brought a small axe with him from the kitchen when we had come upstairs,
and when we had run into the room in which we found ourselves; he had carried it in his
hand and it was on top of the book case with him. I broke into the wall; but before I
had made sufficient space for anyone to pass through, the axe slipped from my
hand into the room in front of me. However, I finished the immediate task easily
with my own hands. We went out towards the Main Street window. One Mr.&nbsp;Klein
helped us next door, and then we were safe. Not one of the children had even wet their
feet; and they had a cozy bed in which to rest that black night. Now another
danger arose—the Catholic church caught fire; and my wife and I watched the flames
of that church and the cruel conflagration of the railway bridge through the night,
thinking of our neighbors—especially of our fellow-countrymen whom we were certain
had been lost from this earth forever.
Such is our history as a family, accurately laid before you. It is generally
believed here that not fewer than ten thousand lives have been lost. More than
fifty—men, women, and children—were lost by the Calvinistic Methodist Church.
Yours sorrowfully.—<span class="sc">Celyddon.</span>
