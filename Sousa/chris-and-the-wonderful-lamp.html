The Library of Congress' Sousa collection, b7f14, contains autograph sheet music
with lyrics for "Act II, opening chorus and dance", dated "JPS Nov 6 1899 NY".
This song doesn't *seem* to be in the p/v score, but I haven't transcribed the
p/v score yet, so I'm not 100% sure.
b7f13 contains the same thing with the lyrics in block lettering, which is easier to read.


<p> To Aladdin a health we will drain
 In a wine that to none is inferior;
 For over us long may he reign;
 As a prince he is very superior!

<p> Fill the cup;
 Fill it high;
 Fill it up;
 Drink it dry
 To Aladdin fair Prince of Etheriaâ€”
 To Aladdin fair Prince of Etheria!

<p> Here in Etheria
 We of the faster set
 Make life a merry dance
 Marked by the castanet;
 Sweetly our melodies
 Charm the auricular;
 Tinkles the tambourine,
 Murmurs the light guitar.
 Tra la, tra la, tra la, tra la,
 Tra la, tra la, tra la la la la la!

To Aladdin a health we will drain, etc.
