<p>This is Charles Klein and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Charlatan</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The dialogue and stage directions are taken from
<a href="https://static.nypl.org/MOTM/Charlatan/charlatan.html">the HTML transcription</a>
made by Tracey E. Chessum circa 2011 “from the copy in the British Library’s
Lord Chamberlain’s Archives,” which she writes was “registered with the Lord
Chamberlain’s Office in London in 1899 [...] transcribed quickly in order to
meet English registration deadlines [...] full of typographical errors.”
Lyrics are largely as they appear in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/charlatancomicop00sous2">the piano/vocal score</a>
published 1898 by the John Church Company, except where Chessum’s London version differed
in an appealing way.
The Act III opener “Note our grumpy growl” was separately published 1899 by the
John Church Company, as
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2023864688/">“Right up on the firing line”</a>;
I have inserted it in the obvious place (as did Martin) despite its absence from
Chessum’s London version.

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

and <a href="http://static.nypl.org/MOTM/SheetMusic/Charlatan/NYPL/1898/Program3.pdf">this souvenir theatrical program</a>
containing photographs and plot summary.

<p>A fully playable performance edition of <i>The Charlatan</i> was created by William Martin and
Jerrold Fisher in the 1980s; a working copy of the libretto circa 1989 belongs to the
Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 76 folder 5). Much of its dialogue and business originated
with Martin, remain under copyright, and differ significantly from this version.

under Russian rule. As the curtain rises, a fair is in progress.
Small theatre <span class="sd">R.</span></i>

<p>[<i>Discovered: A <span class="sc">Chorus</span> of Russian villagers,

<p> Mountebanks, come waken from your dreaming;
 &emsp; Golden dawn is breaking in the sky.
 &emsp; &emsp; Push and hustle,
 &emsp; &emsp; Noise and bustle,
 &emsp; Is in keeping with the day.
 Palpitating hearts with hopes are teeming,
 &emsp; For your posters one and all imply
 &emsp; &emsp; You have new acts—
 &emsp; &emsp; And a few acts
 &emsp; Worth a fortune in their way.
<p> So beat the drum,
 &emsp; Sound the horn,
 &emsp; &emsp; And let your barkers rend the air;
 In crowds we come
 &emsp; On this morn
 &emsp; &emsp; To see the country fair.
<p> Slim acrobats we adore,
 But bearded ladies are a bore;
 The female with the iron jaw,
 &emsp; We’ve seen enough of her.
 The pig that knows the alphabet
 And plays backgammon and roulette
 And grinds "The day when you’ll forget"
 &emsp; We want to see again.
<p> So beat the drum, etc.

<span class="left sc">Boris</span> He was a knight of ancient family—
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; Ah me! Ah me!
<span class="left sc">Boris</span> He swore his heart was hers forever
 &emsp; And that he’d never
 &emsp; Their love-ties sever;
 Her joy would be his one endeavor.
 But, lack-a-day, he left her all forlorn;
 &emsp; And then she sighed,
 &emsp; And softly cried,
 “Why was I born?”
<p> Love dies when wintry skies are gray
 &emsp; And dead and dying are the flowers;
 Love sighs; and if he’s wise, he’ll say,
 &emsp; “The winter’s gone; I’ll wait for summer showers.”
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Love dies when wintry skies, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Boris</span> The jilted maiden dried her weeping eyes—

<span class="left sc">Boris</span> “A fool is she who for a false love sighs—”
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; Ah me! Ah me!
<span class="left sc">Boris</span> There came another gallant wooing,
 &emsp; And softly cooing,
 &emsp; And likewise suing;
 Her wedding ring she’s fondly viewing—
 Which proves it’s good to have philosophy.
 &emsp; If she had moped
 &emsp; Or misanthroped,
 She’d single be.
<p> Love dies when wintry skies, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Love dies when wintry skies, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Boris</span> The philosophic play is told,
 And as the subject’s rather old,
 We all are ready to behold
 &emsp; Your dancers brought from France.
 You call them marvels of the age—
 The wonders of the modern stage—
 The present continental rage—
 &emsp; So let us see them dance.

And you forget his valuable inheritance, which, by edict of the Czar, I, his uncle

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Demidoff &amp; Katrinka</span>
<p> A navigator sailing on the seas that bound the Oriental Kingdom’s shores
Once visited a Chinese city where they had the oddest kind of social laws.
If any stranger took a fancy to a house and hung his hat upon the gate,
The proper caper for the man who lived within was to go out and meditate.
<p><span class="left sc">Kat.</span> Suppose the stranger liked the place and stayed a year;
 Would hubby break the social law and interfere?
<span class="left sc">Dem.</span> Interfere?
<span class="left sc">Kat.</span> &emsp; Interfere!
<span class="left sc">All</span> &emsp; &emsp; Interfere!
<p><span class="left sc">Dem.</span> Why, blesss your soul, he’d slap his chest and inform his dearest friends
 That meditation as a recreation every other form of joy transcends.
 And then with philosophic attitude on etiquette and social laws he’d prate
 While in the house the stranger most contented stays and does not have to meditate.
<p> In faraway Japan they have a custom which I hope will never leave their land:
 The Japanese do not engage in osculation, either on the lip or hand.
 The customary sweet good-night that lovers use when swinging on the garden gate
 Is simply to rub noses once—or maybe twice—and then sit down and meditate.
<p><span class="left sc">Kat.</span> Suppose his nose is of the very Romanesque,
 And hers a pug, quite Lilliputian and grotesque?
<span class="left sc">Dem.</span> And grotesque?
<span class="left sc">Kat.</span> &emsp; And grotesque!
<span class="left sc">All</span> &emsp; &emsp; And grotesque!
<p><span class="left sc">Dem.</span> Why, in that case the duty of the love is to gaze into his sweetheart’s face
 And, placing both his hands on her shoulders in a sort of Japanese embrace,
 Inform her, as his nose compared to hers is ten or maybe fifteen times as great,
 That she should have a start of twenty rubs, while he would wait his turn and meditate.

For a consideration, I want you to produce in your cabinet a princess.

<p> When Mother Earth was in her teens
 &emsp; The frogs were in a muddle.
 They acted like a lot of fiends
 &emsp; And fought in ev’ry puddle.
 Grim anarchy was rampant there;
 &emsp; They had no one to school ’em.
 And so to Jove they sent a prayer
 &emsp; To send some one to rule ’em.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> There were trim frogs, and grim frogs,
 &emsp; And frogs of ev’ry size and hue;
 And mean little green little tadpoles
 &emsp; That were kicking, too.
 &emsp; &emsp; And croaking— croaking— croaking— croak!
 &emsp; &emsp; And croak, croak, croaking.
<span class="left sc">Dem.</span> The moral that I deduce from this pathetic tale
 Is don’t scorn your mutton ’cause you hanker after quail.

<p><span class="left sc">Dem.</span> Jove sent a log to be their head
 &emsp; Who slept without cessation,
 And by his apathy, ’tis said,
 &emsp; Aroused their indignation.
 This king so virtuous and good
 &emsp; These heartless frogs did smother;
 They chopped him into kindling-wood
 &emsp; And begged Jove for another.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> There were trim frogs, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Dem.</span> Jove sent these regicides a stork
 &emsp; Who ruled without much friction,
 And though not given much to talk
 &emsp; Would brook no contradiction.
 When frogs would croak their tales of woe,

 He gobbled frog and woe and so

 &emsp; The summery gummery girl is full of joy.
 The bachelor is practical, tactical, in his genial way;
 &emsp; No frantic’ly, antic’ly words does he employ.
 The widow laughs most merrily, cherrily, bubbling o’er with mirth;
 &emsp; No fearfully, tearfully words she interlards.
 But the frappery, snappery, muttery, sputtery people of this earth
 &emsp; Are the members of the Matrimonial Guards.
<p><span class="left sc">Dem.</span> I am the seventh son of a seventh son,
 &emsp; Likewise a Sunday child.
 To say in magic arts I am number one
 &emsp; Is stating it quite mild.
<p><span class="left sc">Gogol &amp; All</span> Thoughts of dungeons deep and clammy
 &emsp; Fill (my/his) heart with woe.
 &emsp; &emsp; Though (I/he) will sorrow,
 &emsp; &emsp; On the morrow
 &emsp; To Siberia (I’ll/he’ll) go.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> Ah, death and degradation to that very wicked man!
<span class="left sc">Dem.</span> &emsp; If I were he
 &emsp; I think I’d flee
 To China or Japan.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> Yes, death and degradation to that very wicked man!
<span class="left sc">Dem.</span> &emsp; ’Tis my belief
 &emsp; His stay is brief,
 If they work out their plan.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> Death and degradation to this wicked man!
 Thoughts of dungeons, etc.
<p> &emsp; It’s our belief
 &emsp; His stay is brief.
 &emsp; Though he may sorrow,
 &emsp; On the morrow
 To Siberia we hope he’ll go!
