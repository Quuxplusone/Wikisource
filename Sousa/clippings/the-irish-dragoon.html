<p>Some newspaper clippings from 1915 related to <i>The Irish Dragoon</i>.
As far as I can tell, a musical play titled <i>The Irish Dragoon</i> and
starring Andrew Mack <em>was</em> produced in late 1915, but it was not produced
by Klaw and Erlanger (rather E. E. Pidgeon), its book was not by Joseph Herbert
(rather Theodore Burt Sayre), it was not in three acts (but four),
and its music doesn’t seem to have been by Sousa.

<p>Perhaps Sousa abandoned the project and it was sold to Pidgeon; or Pidgeon beat
them to market and therefore Klaw and Erlanger abandoned the project. I’m not sure.

<p>Note that <i>The Irish Dragoon</i> (1915) is set in Napoleonic-era Spain;
Theodore Burt Sayre later wrote <i>The Irish 15th</i> (1917), a story of WWI-era France,
in which Al H. Wilson starred.

<p>Lever’s novel itself contains some two dozen songs or snatches of rhyme,
some with an indication of a suitable melody;
but it seems that neither the Herbert/Sousa project nor the Sayre/Mack project
used any of Lever’s songs, perhaps so that they could obtain copyright in theirs.
<small>In volume 1:
“To drink a toast” (The Man for Galway);
“If I was a monarch in state” (Potteen, Good Luck to Ye, Dear);
“Oh, love is the soul of an Irish dragoon” (The Irish Dragoon);
“Did ye hear of the Widow Malone” (The Widow Malone);
“Then fare ye well, old Erin dear”;
“The morning breezes chill”;
“The pickets are fast retreating, boys”;
“Now that we’ve pledged each eye of blue”;
“What an elegant life a friar leads”;
“Oh, once we were elegant people”;
“It’s little for glory I care”; etc.
In volume 2:
“The day was declining”;
“You may talk if you please” (The Girls of the West);
“Oh, Larry M’Hale he had little to fear” (Larry M’Hale);
“Don’t talk to me of London dames” (Mary Draper);
“If at your ease the girls you’d please”;
“When the battle is o’er, and the sounds of fight” (The Breton Home);
“Bad luck to this marching”;
“My father cared little for shot or shell”;
“Oh, what stories I’ll tell when my sodgering’s o’er”; etc.</small>

<p><b>“Sousa Advocates Woman Suffrage.”</b>
In the <i>Birmingham Age-Herald</i> of Sunday, May 16, 1915,
<a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038485/1915-05-16/ed-1/seq-26/">page 26</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>John Philip Sousa, the famous bandmaster and composer of popular light
operas, as well as marches, has expressed himself in a newspaper interview as
strongly in favor of woman suffrage. In discussing his recent compositions, Mr. Sousa
said to a writer in the Musical Courier that he had recently completed a march
entitled “The Pathfinder of Panama,” which he believed would prove as popular
with the public as the “Washington Post” and the “Stars and Stripes Forever.”
The newspapers throughout the country have given it favorable recognition, and
Mr. Sousa believes the music is just as catchy as the “Stars and Stripes Forever,”
which has been looked on as his most popular march.

<p>The man who wrote the “Bride-Elect,” which has been classed as the most popular
light opera ever written by an American composer, also announced that he had
just completed a new light opera entitled, “The Irish Dragoon,” which was founded
on an incident in Charles Lever’s novel of the same name. Mr. Sousa says that it is
different from most comic operas in that in it there are mainly dramatic incidents.
The book was written by Joseph W. Herbert. The leading role was created for
Andrew Mack, and there is much comedy in the role, Mr. Sousa says. It will be
brought out in New York in October by Klaw and Erlanger and probably Cedar
Rapids will hear it late next season.

<p>Sousa and his band are on their way to San Francisco to fill a nine weeks’
engagement at the Panama-Pacific exposition.

<p>The gallantries and escapades of a dashing young Irish officer and the
machinations of a brother officer, who, because he was cast for the villain,
had to be English; the bellicose Irish nobleman, always spoiling for a
fight, and his typically British foil, personified in the character of the
bluff Colonel Sir George Dashwood; the coolly satirical English beauty
and the <span title="[sic]">irrespressible</span> Irish ingenue;
the clash of swords and wits, and interspersed through it all the good old
ballads and the more modern love songs through which the fascinating
Captain O’Malley showed the audience how “an Irishman’s heart makes
vocal his love,” brought back to memory at the Newark Theater last night
the days of our youth when we pored over the pages of Charles
Lever’s romances of old Erin, and ensconced even more securely in our
admiration the charm and talents of Andrew Mack’s delightful Irish
characterizations.

<p>In the dramatization of Lever’s old favorite the thrills, the intrigues and
the duelling have all been retained, but have been subordinated to the
fascinating figure of the Irish dragoon, whose nimble wit and insouciance
dominate the atmosphere of the play. Only in the duelling scene
in the fourth act are the situations allowed to develop into a semblance
of tenseness. For the rest the plot is light, sparkling and cleverly handled
throughout.

<p>Andrew Mack has an ideal vehicle for his peculiar talents in the romantic
comedy, and maintains to the full his reputation for sympathetic
interpretations of such roles. Colonel Sir George Dashwood, played by Eric
Campbell, offers an excellent foil to the fiery, boastful Count Considine,
played by John Hickey. General Sir Terence Blake is well rendered by Gavin Harris.

<p>Little is required of the women of the cast, beyond the ability to look
bewitching and exchange enough repartee to exhibit the flashing wit of
Captain O’Malley, but the roles were well enacted by Miss Mabel Mortimer,
as Mrs. Blake, the wife of the general; Miss Gilda Leary, as Lucy Dashwood,
the colonel’s daughter, and Miss Josephine Stevens, as Dora Powers, the
ingenue.

<p>“Judy McCann,” the eccentric Irish aunt, impersonated by O’Malley in
order to fulfill a wager, is uproariously funny, and gives the popular
comedian an opportunity to encroach upon the farcical without interfering
with the chief motive of the play.

<p><b>Andrew Mack and Good Supporting Cast Score at Lyceum</b>

<p>Andrew Mack, any time he wishes, can take the first act of “The Irish
Dragoon,” snatch it bodily, cut out a few unnecessary characters and present
a wonderful playlet on the vaudeville stage. The suggestion has probably
never been advanced to him before. “The Irish Dragoon” as far as
its dramatic merits go ends with the curtain on the first act. Whatever
else transpires after that period, whatever takes place in the next three acts
could be easily dispensed with. In fact the last three acts are hanging by a
slender thread on the good impression created by the climax of the first act.

<p>In this play, presented at the Lyceum last night, Andrew Mack portrays the
dashing Irish lover, Charles <span title="[sic]">O’Mally</span>, born of the imagination of Charles
Lever. O’Malley is a captain in the English army, poor but jovial company,
a roistering companion in the barracks, a gallant wooer of women.
He would dare enter where angels fear to tread. In this mood he
finds his way to the home of Colonel Dashwood, where a ball is taking
place. He is desirous of meeting and making love to the Colonel’s charming
daughter, Lucy Dashwood. Chided by his fellow officers he is forced into
making a wager that he can find his way into the good graces of the lady
without even so much as an introduction and further, that he can even kiss
her. It is a big bet O’Malley has undertaken. He meets the daughter of
the Colonel and forthwith she rebukes him. Then, hearing that the young
lady’s grand-aunt, an old Irish lady with a reputation for her caustic wit,
is going to visit the Dashwood home and that she is even then on her way,
O’Malley, aided and abetted by the former sweetheart of the expected
visitor, impersonates the redoubtable Judy McCann. In the guise of the
young lady’s grand-aunt he naturally gets the kiss. He gets more than
that,—three kisses. And just as he is in the midst of the feast in walks the
real Miss Judy McCann. Curtain. What with all the dueling and intrigues
and love affairs that present themselves in the next three acts it is
not worth while reviewing them. Suffice it to say that Andrew Mack has
surrounded himself with a very capable cast, with able men and
pretty women, and what more could an Irish hero want? Gilda Leary,
playing opposite Mr. Mack, makes an ideal Colonel’s daughter. Her little
friend Josephine Stevens was also well received. Others in the cast were:
Gavin Harris, Eric Campbell, George Riddell, Mario Marjaroni, Walter
Grey, Nicholas Joy, John Hickey, William Parke, Jr., Mabel Mortimer,
Julia Hoy and Emily Thompson.

<p><b>John Philip Sousa — Known Throughout World — Our Famous Bandmaster</b>
<p><b>An Interview With the Composer of “Stars and Stripes Forever”</b>

<p>The New York Review declares that if John Philip Sousa had never composed
anything else than “The Stars and Stripes” that woudl have been enough to insure his
name imperishable fame in generations to come, and a niche alongside of Francis
Scott Key and Julia Ward Howe. “The Stars and Stripes” is better known the
world over to-day than “Yankee Doodle,” or “The Star-Spangled Banner,” or, even
“Dixie.” It is played in every country in the world and is almost as popular in
some European countries as it is here.

<p>Mr. Sousa returned to New York this season a little whiter around the temples,
but just the same martial figure he always has been, and as full of energy and
vigor as he was in the days of his youth. The years have not changed the personality
of the remarkable band leader. He is the same kindly, gracious, affable regular
“good fellow” he has always been—full of optimism and engrossed in his work and
his composition.

<p>“The people of this country,” said Mr. Sousa, “are beginning to understand musical
standards and classifications, and insist on having their music served properly.

<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><b>American Judgment Improving</b>

<p>“I have been obliged to keep this in mind constantly in making up my programs, and
I invariably find that everything is judged in respect to the class to which it
belongs, not matter whether it is ragtime or a symphony. The public recognizes that
ragtime with respect to other ragtime compositions may be very bad, and that each
symphony in comparison with other symphonies may be very bad, and that each
form should be considered with due regard to its type only.

<p>“I am very hopeful about the prospects of American music. Our composers have
shown a harmonic development which is unequaled in any other nation in the world.
This is a very good sign. It means musical progress along correct lines and it
will only be a question of time before we produce composers who will rank with the
greatest in history. I can almost see an American Beethoven or a Wagner looming
up in the future now. When the great American composer does come, the public
will be ready to appreciate him, I think.

<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><b>Some of Our Handicaps</b>

<p>“Ours is a cosmopolitan country, and while this presents some advantages in a
musical way, it is a great handicap in the development of national music and it
makes it difficult for a native composer. We are a people of many races, creeds,
tastes and cultures. I do not think that the true American type has yet been fused
in the melting pot and the same thing may be said of music. There are manifestations,
such as our ragtime, our popular songs, which indicate that musical
forces are working and crystalizing certain national characteristics, but representative
American music has yet to be born. It will come into existence some day,
perhaps in a couple of generations, perhaps it will take longer, but it is on its way.

<p>“I am composing all the time. Just at present I am working on the scores of two
operas. One is ‘The Irish Dragoons,’ and the other is ‘Victory,’ which Ella Wheeler
Wilcox wrote with Miss Davis. Besides that I am always writing a new march.

<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><b>About the New Dance Tempi</b>

<p>“The modern dance craze was responsible for a great many new compositions in
the various tempi of the new dances, but beyond this tendency there has been
nothing new. Of course, there is nothing new in the matter of tempo. Everything that
is being written to-day in ragtime and the various syncopated styles has been
done before, perhaps, in different tempi, but I do think that there is a new color
in our music.

<p>“There is an exulting exhilarating note in most of the American compositions of
the day, reflecting our pride in our country. Personally, I do not think that there
should be any trenches in music or art. What people want in music is that it
should have the quality.

<p>“I made three trips around the world with my band, and in every country I
visited I received the same cordial treatment, the same enthusiastic reception and
courtesy. ‘The Stars and Stripes’ was just as much appreciated and applauded in Tokio
as it was in Berlin. There is certainly no national prejudice, or at least there was
none before the great war, in regard to music.

<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><b>War is Fatal to Music</b>

<p>“The war is a musical calamity. Aside from the fact that hundreds of thousands
of musicians are fighting and dying in the armies of the battling nations of Europe
and hundreds of young composers have given up their careers to be soldiers, the
entire musical movement in European nations is stopped, and will not be revived
during our lifetime. The war has killed the musical inspiration of Europe. Modern
music is an art which can flourish only in peace and in highly civilized and
cultured communities. It has nothing in common with present conditions in Europe.

<p>“We shall have to supply our own music for concert and opera for the next 20
years. This will give our composers the opportunities which they claim have long
been denied them, and it will create a market for all kinds of musical composition
here such as has never existed before. But, as I said, I do not expect that a
genuine representative American school of composition will spring into existence
immediately. That is going to take time.

<p>“We are an emotional people; but our emotions as a people are crude, for we
are a very young nation. Our national deity is the American flag, and this fact
is reflected in hundreds of compositions.

<p style="text-indent: 40px;"><b>How He Composed His Best-Known Work</b>

<p>“I have never told anyone just what impelled me to compose the ‘Stars and
Stripes.’ Would you like to know? Well, it was homesickness—just plain, ordinary,
commonplace nostalgia. I had been away from home for almost a year, make a
trip with my band around the world. I first visited the Pacific coast of America,
then the Orient, then Europe, and finally, England, and was coming home again
across the Atlantic on the White Star liner Teutonic, and I do not think that
anyone ever longed to get back to America so intensely as I did. The big ship
could not steam fast enough for me. I looked at hte bulletin board daily to see
how many miles we had run, with bitter disappointment every day that we had not
made better time.

<p>“In a kind of dreamy way I used to think over old days at Washington, when
I was leader of the Marine band of the United States navy, when we played at
all public official functions, and I could see the stars and stripes flying from the
flagstaff in the grounds of the White House just as plainly as if I was back there
again.

<p>“Then I began to think of all the countries I had visited, of the foreign people
I had met, of the vast difference between America and American people and other
countries and other peoples, and that flag of ours became glorified, and to my
imagination it seemed to be the biggest, grandest thing in the world, and I could not
get back under it quick enough.

<p>“It was in this impatient, fretful state of mind that the inspiration to compose
‘The Stars and Stripes Forever’ came to me, and to my imagination it was
irresistible, complete, definite, and I could not rest until I had finished the
composition. Then I experienced a wonderful sense of relief and relaxation. I was
satisfied, delighted with my work after it was done. The feeling of impatience
passed away, and I was content to rest peacefully until the ship had docked and
I was once more under the folds of the grand old flag of our country.”

<p><b>Cast of Giants Refreshingly Combined With Pretty Girls at Orpheum.</b>

<p>The much-heralded, genial-souled Andrew Mack came to Harrisburg Saturday
afternoon and evening, saw and was seen by a certain number of people,
and undoubtedly conquered. The program described what he had to offer
as “A Thrilling, Romantic Comedy Drama,” which was a pretty big bill
to fill, when you look it over. However, it was all of that, and each component
part fulfilled itself remarkably fittingly, and well. The gigantic size
of the majority of the male portion of the cast rather amazed the audience,
but after it had caught its breath and ceased to marvel, the enjoyment of the
hearty good-humor of the play completely absorbed their attention.

<p>Andrew Mack, of course, commanded first attention, and deserved it. His
conception of Judy McCann, whom he impersonated in order to win a wager
from the <span title="[sic]">arch villian</span> of the play, Captain
<span title="[sic]">Eammersley,</span> was exceptionally funny and won the hearts of his
fellow actors as well as those on the other side of the footlights. He was
ably matched off with Miss Gilda Leary, as Lucy Dashwood, a dashing
young lady who was naturally the bone of contention between the hero and
the villain, and was the pivot about which the plot revolved. The scenes
were laid in Ireland and Spain and the play lent itself to the expression of
considerable Irish wit. Lieutenant Sparks as a young and romantic Englishman,
was very much enjoyed, and his <span title="[sic]">appearances on the stage was</span>
the signal for outbursts of appreciative merriment. Miss Josephine Stevens
as the Captain’s sister had the appealing dark eyes which captivated
‘Sparks’ and lent an additional air of feminine charm which would otherwise
have left the situation a little too exclusively masculine.

<p>The inclination toward melodrama which certain portions of the play
suggested may be pardoned as necessary to the successful culmination of the
plot and since the hero escaped from prison just in time to fight to the
death a duel with the villain for the hand of the heroine. Everybody was
entirely satisfied.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Mack, America’s foremost singing comedian, who will be the
attraction at the Providence Opera House for three days beginning next Monday
offers a brand new production in “The Irish Dragoon,” an elaborate scenic
investiture and an exceptional company of known players.

<p>The play is a romantic comedy drama with thrilling scenes and stirring
episodes. Theodore Burt Sayre, who wrote “Tom Moore” for Mr. Mack,
also wrote this new drama. It is a specially arranged version of Charles
Lever’s famous romantic novel “Charles O’Malley,” written around that dashing
dare-devil Galway soldier-boy. It is an intensely interesting story and the
scenes are laid in picturesque Ireland and romantic Spain. There are fifteen
speaking parts and enough military atmosphere to lend color to some stirring
incidents.

<p>In the character of the lovable Captain O’Malley, Mr. Mack has an
ideal type for his talents. During the action of the piece he will sing several
of those ballads which have made Andrew Mack famous and popular as an
Irish comedian. Three of the songs have been specially written by Mr. Mack
for “The Irish Dragoon” and they are “Judy McCann,” “Heart of Mine” and
“For Ireland and You.”

<p>The scenery has been specially painted by Physioc, the costumes have been
designed specially by Ogden, and the complete production is one of the most
elaborate of this season’s offerings.

<p>The supporting company includes Miss Gilda Leary, Miss Josephine Stevens,
Miss <span title="[sic]">Mable</span> Mortimer, Miss Emily Thompson,
Mr. Gavin Harris, Mr. Eric Campbell, Mr. Mario Marjeroni, Mr. Nicholas Joy,
