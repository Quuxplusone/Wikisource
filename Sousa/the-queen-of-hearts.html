<p>This is Edward M. Taber and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Queen of Hearts</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The text, including the “Introductory Remarks,” is taken from a book published
in 1886 by R. O. Polkinhorn &amp; Sons, a copy of which is among the Paul Bierley
papers in the Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 78 folder 2).
Some punctuation has been emended, and the typography has been harmonized with
the other operettas in this series. Larger emendations and corrections
are marked in the text <span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.
<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

<h2 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">The Queen of Hearts,</h2>
<h4 style="margin-top: 8px;">or, Royalty and Roguery. A Juvenile Jingle in One Act.</h4>

<p>Words by Edward M. Taber
<p>Music by John Philip Sousa
<p>First produced at Albaugh’s Opera House in Washington on April 12, 1886
</center>

<hr width="20%" style="margin-top: 60px;"/>
<center><h2>Introductory Remarks</h2></center>

<p>This jingle epitomizes, or rather, elaborates, a thrilling narrative
which has already been brought to the notice of most of us at a tender
age, through the medium of a poem commencing:

<blockquote>
“The Queen of Hearts,<br>
&emsp; She made some tarts<br>
Upon a Summer’s day;<br>
&emsp; The Knave of Hearts,<br>
He found the tarts,<br>
&emsp; And with them ran away.”
</blockquote>

<p>The authorship of this interesting poem is naturally shrouded in the
mystery surrounding most of the literary productions of Mother
Goose, of whose early life and antecedents we have little reliable
information; but as no cipher has as yet been discovered in her poems
which would warrant us in ascribing them to any contemporaneous
writer, it would be unjust to dispute her claim to their authorship. It
is believed, however, that in this instance she must have derived some
assistance from one Hoyle, a technical writer of some repute. The
incidents of the story may be briefly summarized as follows:

<p>The Queen of Hearts, it appears, being somewhat of an epicure, had
an especial fondness for tarts. The legend is silent as to the precise
species of this delightful pastry which afforded the Queen such particular
pleasure, but probably it was a huckleberry tart (a species of
the comestible now unknown). At any rate, it is so assumed in this
jingle. The Knave of Hearts, possessed of an inordinate fancy for
amateur larceny (now known as Kleptomania), feloniously abstracts
a special edition of the royal tarts intended for a reception and banquet,
tendered by the Queen of Hearts to the Courts of three adjacent
Kingdoms, known as the Diamonds, Spades, and Clubs. (See Hoyle.)
The guests arrive in due time, but differ in this respect from the tarts,
which fail to make their appearance at the proper moment, owing to
circumstances already narrated. This catastrophe, acting upon the
susceptible nervous system of the Queen, causes her to swoon, but
serious results are averted by the timely administration of Ammonia;
the virtues of which the Little Joker (the official humorist) takes
advantage of the occasion to extol. The Knave unwittingly betrays his
guilt by an unusual agitation, and the necessity of stringent measures
to discover the culprit which the King of Hearts was about to adopt
is thus obviated. The King summons the Headsman, and the Knave
is about to be decapitated, when the noble-hearted Queen, and the
other ladies, actuated by the magnanimous impulses which are
characteristic of the sex, intercede, and the sentence is commuted to the
punishment of being placed under the pump and saturated with
water. It may be added that the other three Knaves were “accessories
after the fact” in assisting the Knave of Hearts to devour the
purloined pastry, but their share in the crime is undetected, and
(beyond some gastric infelicity) unpunished.

<p>It will thus be seen that the narrative ends without any unpleasant
results, save the involuntary bath of the Knave, and an unexpected
omission in the menu of the banquet.

<p> I’ve a moral aberration
 That’s beyond my explanation:
 Sinful misappropriation
 &emsp; Harmonizes with my mood.
 I’ve an ardent inclination
 For a little peculation,
 Just by way of deviation
 &emsp; From the path of rectitude.
<p> I’ve perused a commentary,
 Read a large vocabulary,
 Pondered o’er a dictionary
 &emsp; With a view to learn the cause;
 And can say that I am very
 Sure it is not customary
 Or accords with temporary
 &emsp; Or with fundamental laws.
<p> There’s a lawful interdiction
 Which is not a legal fiction
 But is meant as a restriction
 &emsp; On this species of exploit;
 But the danger of conviction
 Don’t diminish my affliction,
 For in moral dereliction
 &emsp; I’m peculiarly adroit.
<p> I’ve perused a commentary, etc.
<p> Mysteries of evolution
 And our planet’s revolution
 Are more easy of solution
 &emsp; Than the fact that this defect—
 Which is scarcely Lilliputian—
 Shows no sign of diminution
 In a moral constitution
 &emsp; Which is otherwise correct.
<p> I’ve perused a commentary, etc.
<p> Such is the melancholy fact;
 And so I’ll do some sinful act,
 Some deed of felony and guile,
 In the most nefarious style.
<p> What do I see?
 &emsp; Huckleberry tarts!
 Done to a T
 &emsp; For the Queen of Hearts!
 With a high degree of malice
 I’ll cast gloom o’er the palace
 &emsp; By abstracting the aforesaid tarts.
<p> And when the Queen demands her tarts in vain
 She’ll learn how hollow is a monarch’s reign;
 And royal bliss shall meet plebeian pain
 Upon misfortune’s everlasting plane.

<p> The Frogs, in ages long ago—
 &emsp; So runs the ancient fable—
 No ruler had; a state, you know,
 &emsp; Decidedly unstable.
 And, being in this dismal strait,
 &emsp; To Jove they made petition
 This anarchy to terminate
 &emsp; By filling the position.
<p>[<i><span class="sc">Chorus</span> croaks in imitation of frogs.</i>]
<p><span class="left sc">K. H.</span> “Give us, O mighty Jove, a King
 &emsp; “To sway the sceptre o’er us”:
 Thus did the Frogs assembled sing,
 &emsp; Or rather, croak, in chorus.
 And when their clamor reached his ears
 &emsp; Great Jove was interested,
 And in a Log grown green with years
 &emsp; Despotic power vested.
<p>[<i><span class="sc">Chorus</span> as before.</i>]
<p><span class="left sc">K. H.</span> King Log serene and silent sate,
 &emsp; And ruled that damp dominion,
 But never on affairs of state
 &emsp; Gave dictum or opinion.
 The Frogs became dissatisfied;
 &emsp; Their loyalty grew cooler;
 And once again to Jove they cried
 &emsp; To send another ruler.
<p>[<i><span class="sc">Chorus</span> as before.</i>]
<p><span class="left sc">K. H.</span> Then Jove, incensed, a Stork ordained
 &emsp; As sovereign of the nation,
 Who showed his subjects, while he reigned,
 &emsp; Some novel arbitration.
 When Frogs with grievances would call
 &emsp; He soon their troubles banished—
 He gobbled grievance, Frog, and all,
 &emsp; Till every Frog had vanished.
<p>[<i><span class="sc">Chorus</span> as before.</i>]

<div class="song">
<p><span class="left sc">K. C.</span> If I the moral do interpret rightly,
