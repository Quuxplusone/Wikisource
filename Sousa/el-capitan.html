<p>This is Charles Klein and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>El Capitan</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The dialogue and stage directions are taken from Michael R. Jorgensen’s dissertation
<a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/2de9c71c6b3a8630bc646dd945f453b1/1"><i>John Philip Sousa’s operetta El Capitan: A historical, analytical and performance guide</i></a> (1996),
which contains a libretto “transcribed from a barely legible photocopy of a photocopy”
provided by Loras Schissel at the Library of Congress.
Lyrics are as they appear in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/elcapitancomicop00sous/page/n5">the piano/vocal score</a>
issued 1896 by the John Church Company.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Some of the people have risen again.
Dear me, these insurrections are becoming tiresome.
[<i>To <span class="sc">Isabel</span></i>]
I warned your father that his continued avoidance of public appearances
would lead to something serious.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
And I, your Highness, have repeatedly begged his Excellency
not to deny himself to the people.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
He seems to deny himself to everyone, and deputizes that
detestable Señor Pozzo to represent him in everything— to everybody— even to us.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
It certainly is very annoying to have to ask Señor Pozzo’s
permission every time you wish to see him.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>confidentially</i>]</span>
I shouldn’t be surprised if it is he who is undermining Don Medigua to the people.
<span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span> Oh, I shall insist upon your father’s
dismissing this double-faced wretch. I must remind him that it was my influence
with His Majesty King Philip that secured him the Viceroyship of Peru.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
I have heard that it was the King’s gratitude to Papa.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
What gratitude did the King of Spain owe to your father?

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Did he not make Your Highness his wife, and thus relieve—
I mean, deprive— Madrid of your presence?

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Child, is this your return for my having condescended
to become a second parent to you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Your Highness’s condescension is very evident.

<p>[<i>Commotion heard, off right. All rise to see the cause.
Enter <span class="sc">Pozzo</span>, <span class="sd">R.</span>, followed by <span class="sc">Nevado</span>,
<span class="sc">Montalba</span>, and <span class="sc">Scaramba</span>, whom
<span class="sc">Pozzo</span> tries to restrain as they enter. <span class="sc">Chorus</span> obviously
disturbed at the condition of affairs. The men are dressed as soldiers.
They are very gruff, especially <span class="sc">Scaramba</span>, who glares
about in a most menacing manner. <span class="sc">Pozzo</span> is frightened.</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>bowing low</i>]</span>
Your Highness, these three gentlemen insist on seeing His
Excellency. I endeavored to persuade them to the contrary, but I was
outnumbered, and...

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>haughtily</i>]</span>
What is their errand?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
How majestically beautiful she is. <span class="db">[<i>He sighs</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Who are they?

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Who are we? <span class="db">[<i>The trio laugh</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Nev.</span>
We are delegates...

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
<em>Mounted</em> delegates. Walking isn’t in our line.

<p><span class="sc dr">Nev.</span>
We demand, on behalf of Don Cazarro, the immediate abdication of the present
incumbent—

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Yes, and he’d better be quick about it.

<p>[<i><span class="sc">Marghanza</span> rises haughtily. <span class="sc">Pozzo</span> tenderly restrains her.</i>

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
Your Highness—for my sake—restrain yourself.

<p>[<i><span class="sc">Marghanza</span> indignantly motions him away.
<span class="sc">Montalba</span> tries to restrain <span class="sc">Scaramba</span>.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Scar.</span> [<i>in disgust</i>]</span>
You fellows are too easy. You’ll find that El Capitán will have no such scruples
when he comes.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>to <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></i>]</span>
Inform His Excellency, Don Medigua, that these persons crave an audience.

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
We <em>crave</em> nothing. What we <em>demand</em> is: this palace and its contents,
the keys of the Council Chamber, and Don Medigua’s perpetual absence from Peruvian
soil. Or his interment in it.

<p><span class="dr"><i><span class="sc">Mont.</span> and <span class="sc">Nev.</span></i>
[<i>restraining him</i>]</span> Patience, patience.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Scar.</span> [<i>retiring upstage, in disgust</i>]</span>
Patience! Oh, you ought to have El Capitán to deal with.
The whole palace would have been blown up by this time.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>to <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></i>]</span>
Go.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
How lovely she is in her anger. <span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span> Your Highness,
I retire with an inward conviction that my minutes are numbered.
<span class="db">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
This message will be my <em>ante mortem</em> statement.

<p>[<i>Exit <span class="sc">Pozzo</span>, through the arch.
Delegates retire upstage right, frightening the <span class="sc">Chorus</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Who is that dreadful person of whom they speak?

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
A professional bravo whose name is in everybody’s mouth, known as El Capitán.
The hero of the Barcelona massacre. His only virtue, according to reports,
is an infinite capacity for wholesale slaughter. According to all accounts
he must be a most bloodthirsty man.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
[<i>frightened</i>] And he is here to fight against Papa?

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
He is expected daily. Indeed, there was a report circulated this morning that
he has already landed and is on his way here.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Oh, why did we leave Madrid?

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Pozzo</span>, timidly.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
His Excellency begs that you will excuse him— and accept me. You may hand me
your petition and I’ll—

<p>[<i>Business between <span class="sc">Pozzo</span> and <span class="sc">Scaramba</span>,
who threatens him with his sword.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
You’ll— You’ll nothing. Did you tell him that we wanted to see <em>him?</em>

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
I did.

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Then by San Salvador...

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>rising</i>]</span>
Stop. These creatures evidently forget our royal presence.
Señor Pozzo, arrest them at once.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>frightened</i>]</span>
Your Highness, I would lay down my last drop of life’s blood
for you, but His Excellency instructed me to be sure and use no violence.

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Violence, Montalba! Violence!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mont.</span> [<i>restraining him</i>]</span>
Scaramba, let us retire and inform Don Cazarro that he is defied.

<p><span class="sc">Pozzo</span>
No, no— not defied— referred to a committee.
<span class="db">[<i>Aside, to <span class="sc">Marghanza</span></i>]</span>
The military has deserted us. We are powerless.

<p><span class="sc">Marg.</span>
Coward. <span class="db">[<i>To <span class="sc">Nevado</span></i>]</span>
Tell Don Cazarro that he shall be imprisoned at sunset.
<span class="db">[<i>The delegates laugh boisterously</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
No, no. Everything must be settled amicably.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Oh, why is not Don Medigua here to punish these men for their insolence?

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
Gentlemen, if you will call again, later on...

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Oh, we’ll call again—you can rely on that.

<p><span class="sc dr">Nev.</span>
Come, Montalba. Come, Scaramba. These people either cannot or will not understand
that Don Medigua is no longer <em>recognized</em> as Viceroy.

<p><span class="sc">Scar.</span>
Your Highness will pardon our inability to stay and dine with you.
<span class="db">[<i>To <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></i>]</span>
Just wait until El Capitán gets you into his clutches—he’ll make
but one mouthful of you—and if he doesn’t, I will.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>visibly puzzled</i>]</span>

Precisely—and that’s just what I draw the line at.

I am not afraid, Papa.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Neither am I. In fact, I rather enjoy the excitement. At the same time, if

to make our escape while there is an opportunity. <span class="db">[<i>Points</i>]</span>

And this is Don Medigua, the husband of a princess of the royal blood!

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
The princess of the royal blood has just fifteen minutes to pack the royal trunk
and take her royal departure, for allow me to officially inform the princess
that I am no longer the people’s idol. The office of Viceroy is obsolete, so far as
I am concerned.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Are you going to allow these insurgents to drive us away?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
You can thank your mother. In order to comply with His Majesty’s demands of the
treasury, and pay the princess’ infernally extravagant bills, I have been compelled
to tax the people— or, Pozzo has— and now the people are making attacks on me.
<span class="db">[<i>Begins putting valuables into his trunk</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
Your Excellency, the people have never seen you, and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
And that accounts for my excellent state of preservation. Whenever the people
wanted to see anyone, they saw my representative, Pozzo. If they have any
complaints to make, or any assignations to perpetrate, they can see him now.
In a case of this sort, I prefer to be the power behind the throne—not the
power in it. <span class="db">[<i>Continues packing</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
Your Excellency can rely on me to be firm with the rascals.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
And you can rely on the most poetic epitaph ever chiseled in stone. I’ll compose
it myself. But you must try pacific measures at first. If they fail—the epitaph
is yours. <span class="db">[<i>Bravely</i>]</span> And my duty will be clear.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Spoken like our husband. You will meet this Don Cazarro on the field of battle.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
If Cazarro really means to fight, I shall let him try it on Pozzo. Then, if it
results disastrously for Pozzo, my generalship in taking a back seat will be
apparent to everyone. <span class="db">[<i>Aside</i>]</span> Except Pozzo.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
Your friends will rally around you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Let them rally. I shall not be there to prevent them.
But did you observe how they rallied just now?

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Don Medigua, this weakness ill comports—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Never mind how it comports. I may be a little weak in the knees, but my health
is otherwise quite sound, thank you. Oh, why did I get into politics?
I begged His Majesty not to turn an office-holder out before his time was up.
It invariably creates an unpleasant atmosphere for the newcomer.
<span class="db">[<i>Resumes packing</i>]</span>

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>tenderly kissing <span class="sc">Marg.’s</span> hand</i>]</span>
Your Highness is right. If His Excellency had attended the Council Chamber
in person, he might have created an enthusiasm—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Yes— among my assassins. Don’t you know there are shooting-clubs organized
especially to hurry along my resignation? Do you suppose I am anxious to
shine as a bulls-eye? Well, I guess not!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>rising indignantly</i>]</span>
Don Medigua, are you not going to quell this uprising?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
My dear, the fact that my life is heavily insured seems to make you perfectly
oblivious to the risk I run. I propose to postpone the collection of that
insurance money as long as I can. Besides, insurrections are distinctly Pozzo’s
department. I never interfere with my Senate.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Don Medigua, you have forfeited all claim to our further consideration.
Come, Isabel, we will face these insurgents alone.

<p><span class="sc dr">Isab.</span>
Papa, I beg—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Child, I am adamant. As a student of nature you should know that self-preservation
is its first law. I have more respect for it than all the rest put together.
<span class="db">[<i>Exit <span class="sc">Marghanza</span> and <span class="sc">Isabel</span></i>]</span>
Her ambition will erect a monument over me yet.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Verr.</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]</span>
I presume Your Excellency is aware that both the state and the native military
are supporting Cazarro?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Yes, I know all about it. I’m afraid, Pozzo, you’re going to have a peck
of trouble.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>surprised</i>]</span>
I?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>deliberately</i>]</span>
Well, it won’t be <em>I</em>. I’ve got a scheme.
<span class="db">[<i>Hesitates</i>]</span>
Gentlemen, you will not betray me if I lay bare the innermost secrets of my soul?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Verr.</span> and <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></span>
I promise.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>to <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></i>]</span>
I want <em>you</em> to <em>swear</em>. Your <em>promise</em> has no market value
with me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
I swear.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Then let me inform you that, in order to preserve my incognito—and, I may add,
my life—I intend to become a follower of Cazarro.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Verr.</span> and <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></span>
You?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
I shall breathe insurrection at every pore. Rebellion shall ooze from me at
every step—that is, Cazarro and his mob will <em>think</em> it does.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
I don’t understand.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Before I left Spain I heard that Cazarro intended to regain the Viceroyship at
all hazards. I determined they shouldn’t catch me napping. I allowed Pozzo to
do the napping whilst I— well— you have heard of El Capitán?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>shuddering</i>]</span>
Those fearful delegates mentioned him just now.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
I understand he is the most bloodthirsty man who ever lived.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Or died.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>in astonishment</i>]</span>
Dead! El Capitán dead?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
As dead as the proverbial doornail. Hark ye! Coming over from Spain, one of
my men was killed in a brawl. In looking over his effects I discovered that he
was none other than El Capitán, the redoubtable fighter, a paid spy in the
service of Cazarro, then on his way to join the insurgents. I need not tell
you that I read his funeral services myself— and dropped him overboard without
any reasonable delay.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
But they are expecting his arrival. I heard Scaramba say he had already landed
and was on his way here.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Yes. I spread that report myself. Oh, El Capitán shall not disappoint them—<em>I’ll</em>
take care of that.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
Didn’t you say he was dead? <span class="db">[<i><span class="unclear" title="Pleased with himself">Shakes hands with himself</span></i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
So he is; but I’m not. I intend to join the insurgents as El Capitán. That is why
I’ve been building his stock as a fighter until everybody is crazy to see him.
His reputation is something enormous; but everything you’ve heard about him
emanates from me. When it comes to sounding my own praises, I flatter myself
I can blow a slide trombone with the best of them.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
And you intend to join Cazarro as El Capitán?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
As the real El Capitán has gone to join the devil, I do.

<p><span class="sc dr">Verr.</span>
You may be recognized.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
Yes, yes, yes!

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
No, no, no. No one knows me but a few of my followers. The insurrection was well
under way when I arrived at Peru, and I allowed <em>that</em>—
<span class="db">[<i>indicating <span class="sc">Pozzo</span></i>]</span>
to represent me in everything. They may recognize <em>it</em>, but not me.
<span class="db">[<i><span class="unclear" title="Pleased with himself">Shakes hands with himself</span></i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
You, an insurgent? Dear, dear, what will become of you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
If the insurgents win, as El Capitán I shall come in for a share of the spoils.
If they lose, as the Viceroy I shall hang the ringleaders. It all depends on
General Herbana, to whom Pozzo has dispatched messengers for aid.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
In the meantime, Your Excellency, what will become of me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
That just worries me to death! Oh, you go on enjoying yourself as you are, for
the present. If anyone inquires for me, just say I’ve gone on a vacation.
<span class="db">[<i>Picks up his bag</i>]</span>

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Pozzo</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]</span>
Your Excellency, I would lay down my life for you—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Well, you’ll probably have a chance. I think I can see a large, fat opportunity
opening up for you in that direction. Ah, Pozzo, you always were a lucky dog.
<span class="db">[<i>Shouts are heard in the distance</i>]</span> What’s that?

<p>[<i>All listen intently. The noise grows louder, as if a mob were approaching.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>
It sounds like voices.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>nervously</i>]</span>
Many voices?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Verr.</span> [<i>going to the window</i>]</span>
A great many, I should say.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Th—the more the merrier.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Verr.</span> [<i>at window</i>]</span>
There they are, coming round the Rimac Plaza—the insurgents.
<span class="db">[<i>Draws his sword</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Put up that sword. Do you want us to butchered alive?
<span class="db">[<i>Terrific knocking offstage</i>]</span>
Verrada, look after the women. If the worst comes to the worst, I can protect
myself. <span class="db">[<i>Exit <span class="sc">Verrada</span>, up right</i>]</span>

Place her under arrest and return your prisoner to his cell.

<p><span class="sc dr">Caz.</span>
Why do you not order her instant incarceration?

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Don’t you dare.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
I—oh, this is hard. If she were not a woman I— Your Excellency, this is most ungallant.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Caz.</span> [<i>angrily</i>]</span>
Capitán, order her instant removal into yon prison.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Your Excellency, the prison contains but one cell, and that is occupied by—Don Medigua.

<p><span class="sc dr">Caz.</span>
Well, let her be imprisoned with her husband.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>emphatically</i>]</span>
I object!

<p><span class="sc dr">Caz.</span>
Capitán, why do you object?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Your suggestion is unworthy of you. It— oh, it really cannot be.

<p><span class="sc dr">Caz.</span>
Why not?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
The arrangement is most—un—un-platonic—if not worse.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pozzo</span>

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Estr.</span> [<i>to <span class="sc">Cazarro</span></i>]</span>
Observe his jealousy, Papa.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Pozzo is welcome to my title, but the Princess does not go with it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
You may kill me; but cross the threshold of that prison—never!

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Your Highness, those sentiments are unworthy of the wife of—Don Medigua.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Caz.</span> [<i>hesitating</i>]</span>
I don’t quite understand.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Your Excellency, let us look at this matter from a domestic point of view. The Princess is
a very proficient manipulator of vocabulary, and Medigua is not a good listener. They are
bound to quarrel incessantly. I hate to interfere between man and wife, but the unfortunate
Medigua should be allowed to spend his last few moments in peace.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Caz.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Estrelda is right: he loves her. <span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span>
Very well, she shall go to the Palace. Nevado will see that she is safely caged.

<p><span class="sc dr">Marg.</span>
Oh, we must part? <span class="db">[<i>Throwing her arms around his neck</i>]</span>
Farewell! farewell!

<p><span class="sc dr">Estr.</span>
How dare she? <span class="db">[<i>To <span class="sc">Don Medigua</span></i>]</span>
How dare you permit it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
I can’t help it. She has evidently read about my hundred battles.
<span class="db">[<i>To <span class="sc">Marghanza</span></i>]</span>
Your Highness, those Spanish customs will never go here; really they won’t.

<p><span class="sc dr">Caz.</span>
Come, Capitán. Come, Estrelda.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Estr.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Now for my revenge. <span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span>
Papa, I wish the Princess Marghanza to be present at my ceremony.

What is the meaning of this, Capitán?

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Your Excellency, such a thing would be a gross breach of military tactics— I mean,
court etiquette. The Princess is charged with—with—disorderly conduct. Her presence
would disgrace the wedding solemnities.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Marg.</span> [<i>turning</i>]</span>

 Such as heroes meet in fiction
 &emsp; At the end of volume two,
 At misfortune snap your finger;
 &emsp; Fill with wine your flagon high;
 And your pangs will only linger
 &emsp; Till the jug runs dry.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; Then adieu to care—
 &emsp; &emsp; In the wine so rare
 &emsp; Let us vow the rascal to drown;
 &emsp; &emsp; We will stir his blood
 &emsp; &emsp; In a rosy flood,

 &emsp; &emsp; With a hip-hurrah,

<p> There is comfort, too,
 When a friend’s with you;
 &emsp; Together you clink your mugs
 And soon forget
 That you had met
 &emsp; An incubus called the “bugs.”
 If you haven’t a sou
 To pay your due
 &emsp; You merrily laugh and sing,
 For seen through the drink
 A purse without “chink”
 &emsp; Is the funniest kind of thing.
<p> But if your friend is unpleasantly critical,
 Or if you differ in matters political,
 &emsp; Or in grammar, astronomy,
 &emsp; P’litical ’conomy,
 &emsp; Heathen mythology,
 &emsp; Draw poker-ology,
 Something sufficiently weighty to ripple
 The friendship eternal you swore over tipple—
<p> &emsp; &emsp; Then adieu to care, etc.
<p> But a notion soon will strike you
 That your friend will now dislike you,
 That his love has flown forever;
 &emsp; That’s the climax of your woes.
 So you look across the table
 Just as straight as you are able
 And with bitter tears apologize
 &emsp; For pummeling his nose.

Just a farewell kiss, that was all.

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Capitán, you are—

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
No, I’m not. On the honor of a soldier and a gentleman I am not!

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
Yes, you were going to kiss Estrelda.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Scaramba, you’re getting monotonous. You’re everlastingly piping the same tune.
I know a young man in Zanzibar who did the same thing. He was in love, too.
Do you know what became of him?

<p><span class="sc dr">Scar.</span>
I do not.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
Then I’ll tell you.

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Ditty—<span class="sc">Don Medigua</span>, <span class="sc">Estrelda</span>, and <span class="sc">Scaramba</span></p>
<p> Under the window he softly crept
 While Father and Mother and Towser slept;
 Then, plunking a tune on his light guitar,
 He warbled a ballad of Zanzibar.
 From out her chamber emerged the maid,
 Begging the name of the tune he played.
 Said he as he plunked his light guitar,
 “&hairsp;’Tis a typical tune of Zanzibar.”
 &emsp; Ya— ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya,
 &emsp; Ya— ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya,
 &emsp; Ya— ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya,
 &emsp; Ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya.
<p> “I’m yours for aye,” the maiden cried,
 “I’m ready to marry, to be your bride;
 “Only plunk again on your light guitar
 “That typical tune of Zanzibar.”
 Looking with love on his bride to be,
 He tuned the strings in another key,
 Then plunked once more on his light guitar
 That typical tune of Zanzibar.
 &emsp; Ya— ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya, etc.
<p> Quickly she leaped from the casement high
 Into his arms and ready to fly;
 But Towser had heard the light guitar
 And the typical tune of Zanzibar.
 They buried them down by the ocean’s spray
 Where oft at night, so neighbors say,
 Is heard the plunk of a light guitar
 And the typical tune of Zanzibar.
 &emsp; Ya— ya-ya-ya ya-ya-ya ya ya ya, etc.

Ah, the enemy has begun the attack. General Herbana is punctual.

<em>That</em> is the way to the scene of the conflict, Señor.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Don Med.</span> [<i>very much astonished</i>]</span>
So it is! But I know a nearer way. I propose to execute a flank movement to the enemy’s
rear. It’s a newly imported tactic. I need not say that it is fraught with danger, or I
shouldn’t be there.

<p>[<i>Muffled cannons, rataplan of musketry, etc., going on all through this scene.</i>]

No, I guess not.

<p><span class="sc dr">Estr.</span>
Oh, Capitán, join my father’s forces! There is yet time to redeem yourself.

<p><span class="sc dr">Don Med.</span>
If it’s all the same to you, I’ll remain in pawn.

If Scaramba can ever forgive my having deserted him for you, I will marry him tomorrow.

Lay a finger on me and I’ll have you blown from the cannon’s breech.
