<p>This is Wilson J. Vance and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>Katherine</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The dialogue and lyrics are mostly as they appear in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/katherine-ml50s719k3copy2">the libretto</a>
printed by Wm. P. Kildare in 1879, two copies of which reside in the Library of Congress
(call number ML50.S719.K3.1879). Manuscript lyrics, postdating the Kildare libretto
and differing significantly (especially in Act III), are found in the
Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 241 folders 1–3).

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

love is born in a moment. <em>I</em> believe that all <em>true</em> love comes at first sight.
Maybe he’s a poet—he looks like it—and I dote on poets; or maybe he’s a reporter—and I just

No, I don’t believe I can!

Yes indeed! Your noble father— but tell me, is it true that this young gentleman

<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; By his awful tail!
<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> &emsp; Oh, my heart is beating so,

 Oh! That scene! It will not bear a full re-painting!
 &emsp; Oh, my blood ran slow and cold
 &emsp; As I thought he would enfold—
 Yes, enfold me in his grasp so strong and cruel.
 &emsp; Then I meekly closed my eyes,
 &emsp; For I was the monster’s prize,
 And my life I then resigned—that precious jewel!
 &emsp; Then there came a manly form;
 &emsp; Quick he snatched me from the harm
 That hung o’er me like an awful threat’ning horror.
 &emsp; Springing like a thunderbolt
 &emsp; To the dreadful fierce assault—
 Ah, the sight but added to my shrinking terror!
 &emsp; Thus was Heaven kind to me:
 &emsp; A protector prompt to see,
 Strong to seize the horrid monster and to rend him,
 &emsp; Came upon the fearful scene
 &emsp; And with courage high, serene,
 Saved me from the awful fate that was impending!
<p><span class="left"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>recit.</i>]</span> And yet I am not proud;

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>briskly</i>]</span>
Beg pardon, you know—but I’m a newspaper man, you know, and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh! Tell me, are you a poet, or a reporter?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>loftily</i>]</span>
Well, to tell the truth, I do a little of both.
Flatter myself I can turn out a little poetry quite equal to
the best of them. I’m a newspaper man, you know, and then—and then—I’m from Ohio!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh! Isn’t that nice!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I’m the local editor of the <i>Arcadia Argus</i>. Maybe you’ve heard of it?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Kate</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]</span>
No-o-o, I don’t <em>think</em>— You see, I live in New York, and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Oh, yes, I see! Hasn’t much of a circulation there.
Yes, I toil with my brain, you know—a brain-toiler! That song I just sung I wrote myself.
It was published in the <i>Argus</i>. Ten cents a line, you know. Old Spivins, the editor,
who “has no music in his soul,” and is consequently “fit for treason, strategems, and spoils,”
said he wouldn’t print it for less. But I paid it, and I’m confident my genius, like
<em>all true</em> genius, will be recognized some day.

Yes, I know I am; but I was always so. I must ease my o’ercharged bosom of the perilous stuff.
<span class="sc">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
That’s Shakespeare; but I ain’t sure that it is in quite the right place.
Still I must impress her at all hazards; maybe she won’t notice it; women are not usually

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

Then let me now, fairest one, most peerless of thy sex—
<span class="sc">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
Bad grammar, but that ought to fetch her.
<span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span>
In short, to see thee was to love thee!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, do you know, I’ve so long pined for “some one to love—”

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
“—Some one to caress”? Then take me! Here I am, “free-born and of full age,”
twenty-one years old, a young man from Ohio; a member of the grand aristocracy
of intellect, a brain-toiler, warranted not to cut in the eye, nor run down at the heel—that
is—I don’t mean—I mean—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
I see! You don’t exactly find words—

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
No, I don’t! But accept it, “heavenly maid,” as one of Love’s delicious incoherencies that
mean more than volumes, for “when first I saw thy sweet face—”

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, isn’t it nice?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
What? Your face? Well, I should say—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
No, I mean to love, and be loved!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
I do!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>dramatically</i>]</span>
Kind heaven, I thank thee! Now do I understand why I live! Now do I comprehend the great

Ahem! “Lucius” will do, on account of space, and to save composition.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Poor thing!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes, every girl in school except me had a sweetheart—some of them
two or three at once—and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
The mean things!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Weren’t they? And then I saw you; and the moment I laid eyes on you, dearest
Lucius Quint— I mean, Lucius— I experienced an undefinable— a—

Exactly! I’ve had it myself; had it bad, I may say. I know exactly what you mean. Go on.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
And then I knew that I loved you, and would always love you, for ever and ever and ever,
and would never part from you, and would never love anybody else! But you’ll always call
me Katie, won’t you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Indeed I will.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
For Paw, you know, says I was christened Katherine, when I wasn’t; for I guess I know,
for wasn’t I there?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Must have been. But never fear, I’ll always call thee Katie, for though
by any other name you’d smell as— no, I mean— I never will cease to love thee!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
When we calmly look back at it, isn’t it strange?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
What strange?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
How we love each other so deeply, truly, and fondly—and to think I was wanting a sweetheart
so badly, and all at once I saw you, and then— Oh my, isn’t it nice?

Oh, I see it all. Haven’t I eyes? You’ve been crazy for a year to have a sweetheart. You’ve lived

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
Yes indeed. You’ve been very blind if you haven’t seen it. Why, it’s the talk of the whole house.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
But how will that help me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
Why, if you make a fuss and worry him about <em>his</em> love affair, he will be glad
to do something to placate you; and then you can make your consent conditional upon his.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, Lottie, do you think—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
If he won’t let you love your sweetheart, don’t let him love his! That will bring him to terms.
But you’ll have to have a scene, and you must be very firm and unyielding. It’s a game
two can play at.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

 And, loving, played amid her golden hair.

 &emsp; Smiled at this loving play,

 The fond youth kissed a lock of golden hair;

drink left him in, till we got him here. He’ll wake soon. Meanwhile, let’s sing a song or two.
All’s quiet, and the cops haven’t tumbled to our racket yet. Fill up, boys, and we’ll have
“Kit the Kidder.”

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Bill</span>
<p> My song is of a kidder bold, blithe, and free,
 &emsp; Who lived out Jersey way;
 He was a jolly feller, as all might see,
 &emsp; So often I’ve heard say.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then sing the song of the kidder bold,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The kidder blithe and free!
 &emsp; &emsp; And when I have his story told,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; You’ll be obleeged to me.
<p><span class="left sc">Bill</span> His trade was light and neat and clean, you may see;
 &emsp; His capital was small;
 And when times were dull, as frequent times will be,
 &emsp; He made a water-haul.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then sing the song of the kidder bold,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Whose capital was small;
 &emsp; &emsp; Alas! a deep grief would him enfold
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; When he’d make a water-haul.
<p><span class="left sc">Bill</span> A pew he run on Brooklyn side, an A-1 pew,
 &emsp; Quite piously inclined;
 It served him well to push his trade, as it may you,
 &emsp; If you’ve a thrifty mind.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then sing the song of the pious Kit,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Who had an A-1 pew;
 &emsp; &emsp; Which served him well, so he stuck by it,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; As pious people do.
<p><span class="left sc">Bill</span> Now Kit he loved a maiden fair, fair to see;
 &emsp; Her name was ’Lizbeth Ann;
 And most dearly she loved Kit, aye, that did she,
 &emsp; As often maidens can.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then sing the song of ’Lizbeth Ann,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Who loved the pious Kit;
 &emsp; &emsp; For he was an enterprising man,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; As may account for it.
<p><span class="left sc">Bill</span> But all his bright prospects he sent straight to pot,
 &emsp; All on a most unfortunate day;
 For Kit married the girl when his love was hot
 &emsp; And then there was the dickens to pay!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then come, sing the song of this poor boy,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; As you may rightly say;
 &emsp; &emsp; Who lost his head and went in for joy—
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Oh, most unlucky day!
<p><span class="left sc">Bill</span> For instead of a kidder, blithe, free, and bold
 &emsp; Who loved a quiet way,
 He was a henpecked man, <span class="unclear" title="Kildare: “for so I am told”">I’m told</span>,
 &emsp; For so the neighbors say.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Then mournfully sing the kidder bold,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Who gave himself away
 &emsp; &emsp; And grew quite thin and likewise quite bald
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; For love, as you may say!

<p>[<i>During the song <span class="sc">Wyvern</span> begins to toss about uneasily. Finally,

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Brown</span> [<i>addressing <span class="sc">Wyvern</span></i>]</span>
Well, precious one, darlin’ tootsey-wootsey, has it had a nice nap? Would it like to see its
darling Clothilde?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Where am I, sir? What does this mean?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Bill</span> [<i>assuming a confidential tone and air</i>]</span>
You see, the fact is, pard, you got a little full last night and had to be assisted, as you may say.
You, not to put too fine a point on it, were so disgracefully tight that we couldn’t think of
leaving you home—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>impatiently and imperiously</i>]</span>
How came I here, sir? What does this mean?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Bill</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]</span>
That’s just what I was a-comin’ to, sir, when you interrupted me. Try to be calm and I’ll make
it all plain to you. As I was a-sayin’, you were in such a lamentably disgraceful condition of
intoxication as would have broke your own Clothilde’s heart to see you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
How dare you speak so familiarly of—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Go easy, pard! Don’t get excited; you might say something that you didn’t mean to say, you know.
Least said, soonest mended. As I was sayin’, we brought you here to keep you till you got all
sobered up comfortable and nice.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
<em>Will</em> you tell me—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
In course I will. Seein’s we didn’t want you to disgrace yourself, bein’ friends of your’n—

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Friends of mine—! I never saw you before in my life!

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Oh, come now; yes, you have. Think a little. Can’t you remember me, for instance? or my friend
the Reverend Mr. Brown, as sits over there smokin’ and smilin’ and overlookin’ your disgraceful
conduct just as friendly-like as—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
The fact, is, governor, I reckon you don’t remember much about last night’s performances, do you?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>very much bewildered</i>]</span>
I remember nothing but the ball; and after supper I— I don’t, somehow—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
No, I thought you didn’t. Fact is, you were in a very bad shape; so we played the good Samaritan
on you, you see—for fear harm might come to you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Precisely. Just as the Reverend Mr. Brown says. Why, think of it. If it hadn’t been for us
old friends a-lookin’ after you, you might have fallen into the hands of wicked, bad, designing
men, who might have robbed you, you see.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Where am I?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
A very proper question for you to ask, and it does me proud to assure you that you are in the
hands of truly good men who run a branch of the Young Men’s Christian Association.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Yes, and likewise the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Idiots.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Enough! If you have cared for me so kindly, I will be glad to remunerate you and take my leave.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Now, that’s what I call handsome. Didn’t I tell you, brother Brown, says I, “Here’s a man that
will appreciate our thoughtful care and act accordin’.”

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
All right; but where do you propose to go to?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
After my conduct of last night, which you very properly characterize as disgraceful, I think
I’d better get right back to New York, and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
—And you’ll be delighted to know that that’s just where you are now!

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
What, in New York? How—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Precisely so! A gentleman always knows how to feel for another gentleman, and so—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
We saw how your feelings would worry you, and so we just brought you over on the early milk train;
and here you are—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
“Right side up, with care,” sound ’s a dollar, and all comfortable.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span>
[<i>rising to go, and handing <span class="sc">Brown</span> a bank-note</i>]</span>
Very well, my good fellow. This, I trust, will reimburse and remunerate you;
and with many thanks for your kindness, I will go.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Brown</span>
[<i>looking at the money</i>]</span>
Ye-e-es. Don’t you think, governor, that you are squandering too much money on the
cause? Ten dollars is a good deal in these times to a poor man, and maybe you can’t
really afford to be so lavish.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Oh, never mind that, sir! That’s all right. I don’t think it’s too much, for you really
seem to be a worthy set of fellows.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Poor, but respectable and honest and deservin’. You’ve hit it about right, governor;
but, as the Reverend Mr. Brown says, ten dollars seems to be quite princely.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Don’t say any more; and—ah!—good day, gentlemen.

<p>[<i><span class="sc">Wyvern</span> goes to the door, where he is confronted
by <span class="sc">Bill</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
But really, governor, we couldn’t think o’ lettin’ you go and deprive us of your delightful
society in that way.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>nervously</i>]</span>
What do you mean?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
And don’t you think it’s rather hard on us, to go and tear yourself away from loving friends
and comrades, as a fellow might say?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But really, my friend, I must go.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
And not even leave us a lock of your hair—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Or a check on the bank for a few thousand—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
—to remember you by?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
It strikes me that this is nonsense. I have had enough of it. Be kind enough to let me go.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Couldn’t think of it just yet, governor. We’re too fond of you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Fact is, my distinguished friend, we couldn’t think of parting with you for less than—well, say
ten thousand dollars.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Am I to understand that you will not release me unless I pay you money?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
You struck it that time, pard. A fellow can easy see that you’ve been a business man all your life!
Just think how he gets right at the marrow of the thing, quick as a flash.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
How dare you attempt such a thing as this? I’ll not stand it. I’ll alarm the neighborhood—call the police—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
I wouldn’t do that, if <em>I</em> was in your place. You see that there are several of us here;
and we want money, and want it bad; and when we undertook this little speculation we counted the cost.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Don’t injure your health, governor, strainin’ your lungs hollerin’ for the cops. I knowed a fellow
to drop off very sudden onc’t not long ago, just in that way. Right in this room, too, come to think of it.
<em>He</em> wanted to get out, away from his friends and admirers, just as <em>you</em> do; and
<em>he</em> hollered for the police, and— and— Well, as I was sayin’, he dropped off mighty sudden-like.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Gracious heavens! You don’t mean that the man was killed?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Now, I didn’t say anythink of the sort. I was careful to explain that he strained his lungs hollerin’
for the cops. I thought I’d tell you—just as a sort of a warnin’ like, you know.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>badly frightened</i>]</span>
But I have no money with me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Never mind; we’ll take your check, and you can stay here, you know, till one of your friends here
runs around to the bank and gets the money.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
What a head for business my reverend friend has got, now, hasn’t he? Why, I could tell you thousands
of just such things that I have seen him do.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Very well. I suppose as I’m at your mercy, I may as well do as you say.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Now, that is business! And then you can hie thee to thine own sweet Clothilde! Think of that!
Think of the rapture of that meeting! Think of enfolding her onc’t more in one long embrace!
<span class="db">[<i>During this speech <span class="sc">Wyvern</span> writes and signs a check,
which is at once seized by one of the gang, who goes out to get it cashed.</i>]</span>
While we’re waiting, couldn’t you give us a good comic song, governor? That one you sung
last night, for instance. Ah, you were in fine voice then, and sung it lovely—something
about champagne?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>faintly</i>]</span>
No; I can’t sing. Oh! this dreadful place!

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Never mind; we’ll give <em>you</em> a song to cheer you up. Come, boys!

<p><span class="left sc">Brown</span> Aye, pour me a can of good foaming beer.
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; Fizz, pop, bang! fizz, pop, bang!

<span class="sc">Clothilde</span>, and <span class="sc">Brown</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Smith</span> [<i>stepping to the door</i>]</span>
And now I think our friend Signor Strongi-Lungi, of Her Majesty’s Italian Opera, can
give us the rest of the story.
<span class="db">[<i><span class="sc">Brown</span> tries to reach the door</i>]</span>
Don’t tear yourself away. You are so versatile and so entertaining that we couldn’t think
of sparing you just yet.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
What-a do you mean-a?

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Drop it, Brown. If you had Bill with you now, you could entertain us vastly with your dancing
bear—“<i>mon</i> brav’ bear.” Then you might favor us with your “Diggee, washee, and cookee”—that’s
a good song, and you really sing it well.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
I will not-a be treated in-a this manner. What-a know I of a dancing bear, “Diggee, washee, and cookee”?

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Possibly your wife there
<span class="db">[<i>indicating <span class="sc">Clothilde</span></i>]</span>
could help you refresh your memory. I know that Mrs. Brown, with that beautiful fidelity
which characterizes the sex, would not desert you in your hour of darkness.
<span class="db">[<i>Bows elaborately to <span class="sc">Clothilde</span>, who trembles</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
What on earth does all this mean?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
It’s plain as a pikestaff. Your respected parent has been duped by the wife and robbed by the husband!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>fiercely, to <span class="sc">Clothilde</span></i>]</span>
Are you this man’s wife?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
She ’ave ze honair to be ze wife of Jacques-Pierre!

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
And who are <em>you?</em>

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
I seem to be Brown just now. These two young fellows have been too much for me, I must confess.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Merciful heavens, what an egregious ass they have made of me!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
And yet, you are not proud.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Young man, beware! You may go a step too far. Don’t rouse the sleeping lion in my—

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
All right, old gentleman. As long as my own Katie still loves me,
<span class="db">[<i>approaching <span class="sc">Kate</span> and trying to take her hand</i>]</span>
I can bear up under “the proud man’s contumely.”

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
But really, Mister— Mister Jones—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>in great astonishment</i>]</span>
<em>Mister Jones?</em>

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes; we’ve had our pleasant little flirtation, and now it might as well end.
I start back to school to-morrow, anyhow.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
But you loved me so! And you deliberately announced your purpose to love me forever and
ever and ever—for an indefinite period, in point of fact!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes, I know; but that was when Paw said I shouldn’t love you at all.
Now that I am at entire liberty, I don’t seem to care to do so. Singular, isn’t it, Lu?— that is,
I mean, Mr. Jones?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Yes, very! So I’m mittened, sacked, sold out, and all that! Well, shall I fly to poetry for
relief? “Maid of Athens—leastways of New York—ere we part, give, oh, give me back my heart.”

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Kate</span>
<p> And thus we end our holiday;
 To some ’twas work; to some ’twas play.
 Young Cupid’s had a merry dance;
 He always does, where bright eyes glance!
 To some he gave a heavy load;
 On them he perpetrated fraud.
 To some, we know, it was jolly—
 A harmless bit of pure folly.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; The worst wounds won’t be long healing,
 &emsp; &emsp; Except the one that Hymen’s sealing.
 &emsp; &emsp; The knaves, of course, shan’t go unhung;
 &emsp; &emsp; Their sentence, though, may be unsung.
 &emsp; &emsp; The fools who bit at naked hooks
 &emsp; &emsp; Surely are high in Fortune’s books.
 &emsp; &emsp; They’ve had a chance, at slight expense,
 &emsp; &emsp; To gain a modicum of sense.
<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> Perhaps the lesson won’t be lost.
<span class="left sc">Kate</span> On Paw? Oh, no; think of the cost!
<span class="left sc">Both</span> The lesson sure was strong enough
 E’en for one so tough.
<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> He’ll venture now less freely—
<span class="left sc">Kate</span> &emsp; His head will be less mealy!
<span class="left sc">Clo.</span> ’Tis an unwelcome lesson—
<span class="left sc">Kate</span> &emsp; ’Twill make a good impression!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; The god of mischief’s had his day
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; And good healthy fun he brought us.
 &emsp; &emsp; He did no damage with his play
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; And some good lessons taught us.
 &emsp; &emsp; We’ve had the sport, we’ve had the fun,
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; And we’ve all enjoyed the frolic.
 &emsp; &emsp; It’s helped the wise—yes, every one—
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; And it’s cured the melancholic!
<p><span class="left sc">Wyv.</span> &emsp; And yet I am not proud;
 &emsp; Humility’s my forte
 And a shrinking, modest tendency’s my fault!
<p><span class="left sc">Luc.</span> I’ll hie me home, a lesson learned;
 I tampered with fire and had my wings burned.
 When a game bird next I’m looking for,
 I’ll choose me one worth cooking, sir!
<p><span class="left sc">Smith</span> I surely am the favored one!
<span class="left sc">Lot.</span> No happier girl beneath the sun!
<span class="left sc">Both</span> Young Cupid’s surely won our prize
 &emsp; For his winning ways.
<span class="left sc">Smith</span> He’s taught us the old story—
<span class="left sc">Lot.</span> The ever new old story!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; The worst wounds won’t be long healing, etc.
