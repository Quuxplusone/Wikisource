<p>This is Leonard Liebling and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Glass-Blowers</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>So far, this is just a transcription of
<a href="https://archive.org/details/the-glass-blowers-liebling-sousa-pv">the piano/vocal score</a>
(John Church Co., 1913). I lack a (public-domain) source for the book.
<p>A version of <i>The Glass-Blowers</i> edited by Jerrold Fisher was staged by
<a href="https://www.christopheralden.net/Glassblowers.htm">Glimmerglass Opera</a> in 2000 and 2002.
The Victorian Lyric Opera Company of Rockville, Maryland,
<a href="https://www.vloc.org/the-american-maid-2012.html">produced</a> a semi-staged version of
<i>The American Maid</i> in 2012.
It’s unclear to me whether either production included dialogue, and if so whether the dialogue
was due more to Liebling’s efforts or to Fisher’s.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).
<p>See also <i>The American Maid</i>’s entry in Paul E. Bierley’s

and <a href="./clippings/the-american-maid.html">some newspaper clippings</a> on the subject.

The Library of Congress' Sousa collection, b1f12, contains autograph sheet music
with a beginning of lyrics for a song "The Brotherhood of the Union" which doesn't
appear in the printed p/v score.

  "The Brotherhood of the Union"
  Song (Jack) with Principals and Chorus

A life in the tropics is not to my taste
It seems nothing to me but the blue devils
When away from New York I feel sadly misplaced
I long for Broadway and its revels. [...]
Philadelphia, Philadelphia! [...]
The brotherhood of the union,
  the brotherhood of the union,
Long may it [...]

The Library of Congress' Sousa collection, b1f17, contains autograph sheet music
with lyrics for a song "It was really very fortunate for me," marked "Charles Brown"
(name of the lyricist?).

  Charles Brown: “It was really very fortunate for me”

D’you know, I think that bravery's a splendid thing, don't you?
I speak as one who knows a little bit about it, too;
For instance, once when fighting for my Country and my King,
They picked me out to lead a charge: a most unpleasant thing.
The colonel said: [recit.]
  “My lad, you go to certain death, but as a hero you’ll remain forever in the minds of men.”
As into the fray I pressed,
Quite instinctively I guessed
That my shoelace was unfastened, so you see
I had to stay to tie it, while my comrades, sad to tell,
Got on ahead where all of them heroically fell;
While I lived, and got a medal for my bravery as well,
Which was really very fortunate for me!

 He didn’t cater to the mob; he knew not vim or snap.
 The Bard of Avon—this is not a knock not yet a boost—
 Would have an awful time to-day to get <i>Macbeth</i> produced
 Unless he made the witches six tall show-girls dressed in green,
 A pony ballet full of ginger in the cauldron scene,
 With up-to-date vocabulary for each pretty miss,
 To follow with a swishy dance the lines that go like this:
<span class="left">[<i>Mysteriously</i>]</span> &emsp; “Thrice the brindled cat hath mewed,
 &emsp; “Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

 King Richard Third would no more spring that old and honored spiel
 About his kingdom for a horse, but an automobile.
 Othello’d have to have a song to sing in baritone
 Like “The Sun Shines on Morocco,” or “My Darling Desdemone”;
 While Antony, of regal Cleopatra growing fond,
 Might get a hand with his new song “My Gal’s a Strawb’ry Blonde.”

<p><span class="left sc">Ger.</span> She was dainty as a fairy
 Of some story legendary;
 Just a trifle mercenary,
 &emsp; I regret.
 Though she led on his advances,
 Heard his passionate romances,
 She congealed his ardent glances
 &emsp; When they met.
<p> In the dimness of twilight he told his love,
 &emsp; And over and over he cried:
 “I love you, yes, love you,
 &emsp; “And wish you to be my bride.”
 All blushing she whispered, “I’m young and shy,
 &emsp; “But if you are really sincere,
 “I’ll love you, yes, love you,
 &emsp; “If you’ll give me ten thousand a year.”
<p><span class="left sc">Duke</span> With a <i>dolce far niente</i>
 He said, “Ten? Why, make it twenty.”
 “Ten will do,“ she said; “that’s plenty.
 &emsp; “Name the day.”
 After marriage he grew colder;
 Never lost a chance to scold her;
 When she asked for money told her
 &emsp; “Go away.”
<p> In the dimness of twilight she told her love,
 &emsp; And over and over she cried,
 “I love you, yes, love you,
 &emsp; “And when I became your bride,
 “You promised to give me a tidy sum.

 “So tell me, come tell me,

 And he raised an awful clatter,
 But she was a good stand-patter,
 &emsp; Heaven knows.
<span class="left sc">Duke</span> Then they said things to each other
 Till she wired for her mother,
 And he told his bach’lor brother
 &emsp; All his woes.
<span class="left sc">Ger.</span> &emsp; All his woes—
<span class="left sc">Duke</span> All his woes—
<span class="left sc">Ger.</span> &emsp; All his woes.

 “I’ll leave you, yes, leave you,

 We do not claim excessive grace;
 Black our hands and face.

<p> There’s a legend of old,
 By the Saracens told,
 Of a royal maid who had loved in vain
 &emsp; A princely swain.
 So this maiden fair
 Steeped in doubt and despair,
 Sought the mystic aid of the airy
 &emsp; Fairy
 Elfins of Cupid’s land.
 Ah—! Ah—! Ah—!
<p> When the Elfins had heard
 To the very last word
 All the maiden’s woe—how her heart was torn,
 &emsp; Her life forlorn—
 Cried they: “Do not be sad;
 “&hairsp;’Tis the time to be glad;
 “For we fairies know how to lead hearts,
 &emsp; “Speed hearts,
 “Unto the hearts they love.”
<p> For in our fairy bower
 We wake with magic power
 A wondrous lute of crystal made
 Whose golden tones true lovers aid.
 When hearts responsive hear it
 They hasten to be near it,
 And with caresses
 Love confesses
 &emsp; Love to Love.
 Ah—! Ah—! Ah—!
<p> So the legend of old,
 By the Saracens told,
 Said the melody by the fairies played
 Proved to prince and maid
 That their hearts beat as one;
 And no souls ’neath the sun
 Could more happy be.
 &emsp; For true love,
 &emsp; New love,
 Ever and aye shall be.
 &emsp; Yes, ever shall be.
 True love, new love, ever shall be.

 In wood and thicket, dark and still,

 Far in the east a phantom gray
 &emsp; Steals slowly up the night’s black pall,
 And herald of the coming day

 And the Red Cross nurse, risking life for life,
 &emsp; Is the bravest and best of all.
<p> Red Cross! Red Cross! guarding the dead and dying;
 &emsp; Under your shield
 &emsp; On battle field
 The wounded are peacefully lying.
 Red Cross! Red Cross! soothing the pain and weeping;
 &emsp; O’er soldier brought low,
 &emsp; Be he friend or foe,
 Your vigil you ever are keeping.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Red Cross! Red Cross! etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Ann.</span> When rifle and spear and the pistol and lance
 &emsp; Are no more to be call’d into action;
 When all is good cheer and the song and the dance
 &emsp; Take the place of the quarreling faction;
 When right will prevail in the souls of mankind
 &emsp; And sorrow give way unto mirth,
 The flag of the Red Cross will then be enshrined
 &emsp; In the hearts of all nations on earth.
<p> Red Cross! Red Cross! etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Red Cross! Red Cross! etc.
