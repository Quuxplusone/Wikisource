&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Perhaps, from your view, they are not.
But I can’t see them using both my eyes
So tell me truly, put me hep or wise.
To all the phonies of you Yankee guys,
&emsp; when someone sings such rot—
&emsp; &emsp; Such Thomas rot—
&emsp; &emsp; This sort of rot:

Remember your engagement, sire—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Crestfallen</i>]</span>
My engagement looks like a battle.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Interested</i>]</span>
Troubled, sir?

<p><span class="sc dr">Parks</span>
Yes. You know old Pompton thinks I’m a fool.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>With spirit</i>]</span>
Don’t stand for it.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Expectantly</i>]</span>
What shall I do, Stumpy?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Wisely</i>]</span>
Make him prove it.
<span class="db">[<i>Bus. as both look knowingly</i>]</span>
Oh, sir— <span class="db">[<i>offers paper to <span class="sc">Parks</span></i>]</span>
O.K. this please.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Taking paper</i>]</span>
What’s this for?

<p>[i><span class="sc">Parks</span> busy reading paper.</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Unconcerned</i>]</span>
Only some more tires—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Quickly and roars</i>]</span>
More tires; great scott, what do you do, eat them?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Sorry</i>]</span>
No sir, but I’m tired—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Quickly</i>]</span>
I should say you were, not only physically but automobileacally,
where’s your expense account for yesterday?
<span class="db">[<i>Businesslike</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Mack</span>
There it is—

<p>[<i>Bus. as Mack unfurls a long roll of paper across stage

<p><span class="db">[<i>Smiles</i>]</span>
That’s all I’ve had time to put down—

<a id="p4"><hr style="margin: 40px 0;"></a>

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Gasping at bill</i>]</span>
Are you sure you didn’t forget something?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Thinking</i>]</span>
I <em>think</em> that’s all <em>we</em> spent.

<p><span class="sc dr">Parks</span>
<em>We</em> spent?
<span class="db">[<i>Examines bill</i>]</span>
Why these extra spark plugs?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Winks knowingly</i>]</span>
Sparking, sir—
<span class="db">[<i><span class="sc">Parks</span> glances at him wisely</i>]</span>

Shield, sir—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Hotly</i>]</span>
Hot air—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Saluting and unconcerned</i>]</span>
No, wind, sir!

<p>[<i>Bus. as Stumpy starts to roll up bill</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Stops him</i>]</span>
What’s that?
<span class="db">[<i>Points to bill</i>]</span>

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Looks, then smiles</i>]</span>
Vintage,—er—for the machine—gasoline, sir.
<span class="db">[<i>Keeps on rolling up bill</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Parks</span> [<i>Severely</i>]</span>
Stumpy, <em>you’re</em> spending altogether too much money—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Explanatory</i>]</span>
But, sir—

<p><span class="sc dr">Parks</span>
Don’t Butt me, you’re not out in the car now. You must reform your
daily expenditures, like I am going to reform.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mack</span> [<i>Surprised</i>]</span>
You, sir?

Oh, dear me, I’m afraid you’ll imagine me a regular bear—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Gerl.</span> [<i>Quickly</i>]</span>
No fear Duke, bears are noted for their hugging.
<span class="db">[<i>Bus. for her expectant</i>]</span>

Aren’t they clumsy creatures too? What?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Gerl.</span> [<i>Hurt</i>]</span>
They at least realize what they are doing.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Duke</span> [<i>Perplexed as to what to say</i>]</span>
Oh, by the by, has your fortune ever been told?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Gerl.</span> [<i>Warmly</i>]</span>
Father will probably tell you if you are interested.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Duke</span> [<i>Embarrassed</i>]</span>
Oh, may I—may I—
<span class="db">[<i>Bus. of Gerl, expectant</i>]</span>
May I kiss—

<span class="db">[<i>Self-confessed</i>]</span>
But I have no veil on.

 I like your style
 And your sweet smile
 Makes my heart feel so funny;
 Just ’cause you said

 Some day if my dreams should come true,
 A carriage we’ll keep for the baby
 And Sundays I’ll drive it for you.

 But for me, I adore
 Just you, dear; and you’re worth all the others;
 I haven’t the cash,
 So we can’t cut a dash,
 But I love you, so nothing else bothers.
 In some little flat
 We’ll make a start
 With everything new and fine,
 There we will be happy,
 And never be scrappy,
 When you change your name to mine.
<p><span class="left sc">She</span> I shall learn to do cooking
 &emsp; I’ll bake some pies,
 &emsp; As a surprise;
 And for you I’ll be looking
 &emsp; By the front door
 &emsp; Each day at four.
 I’ll never be jealous or scold you,
 &emsp; Your wages I’ll keep for you dear.
 With bank-books in my name I’ll hold you,
 &emsp; Should love for me cool as I fear.
<p><span class="left sc">Refrain</span> There’s girls by the score 
 But just me you adore,
 I’m your dear and I’m worth all the others.

 With ev’rything new and fine.

 When I change my name to thine.

Good things come high.

Preposterously high. Just think of it—fifty thousand

Hello Jack, I came to conform a review.

<p><span class="sc dr">Col. V.</span>
About <span class="unclear" title="Something illegible — [Paught?] — written above">you</span> and the Esperanza oil fields—

<p><span class="sc dr">Jack</span>
And you wish to know.

<p><span class="sc dr">Col. V.</span>
I’ve just learned that Pompton was the <span class="unclear" title="Possibly mistranscribed">disturbing</span> element
in the Syndicate that refused my option and
deliberately planned to ruin me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Jack</span>
That’s what they say <strike>at the club</strike> on Wall St.

<p><span class="sc dr">Col. V.</span>
And when my stock was thrown in the market
he bought huge blocks at a ridiculously low
figure.—

<p><span class="sc dr">Jack</span>
And would have bought all at a still lower
ridiculous figure if I hadn’t appeared
on the horizon and gobbled up the rest.

<p><span class="sc dr">Col. V.</span>
Then you helping is it as an investment.

<p><span class="sc dr">Jack</span>
Sure. As soon as Mexico rights itself,
the Esperanza will be worth millions.

Oh no! He would get up on his hind legs

<p><span class="left sc">A.</span> &emsp; Beating fast
<p><span class="left sc">J.</span> &emsp; Not too fast.
<p><span class="left sc">A.</span> &emsp; Yes, too fast.
<p> You do not need a doctor
 But only love and laughter,
 The glances of a maiden
 Just now is what you’re after,
 You’d start the welkin ringing
 Likewise you’d shake the rafter,
 If she you love, your turtle dove,
 &emsp; Would smile
<p> I do not, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">J.</span> I think my heart is quite affected.
<p><span class="left sc">A.</span> No one would ever have suspect it.
<p><span class="left sc">J.</span> Feel the throbbin’
<p><span class="left sc">A.</span> Why it’s bobbin’
<p><span class="left sc">J.</span> Never ceases.

<div class="song">
<p> J. Caesar’s Roman soldiers as they journeyed to their fights
 Would have to pose as Amazons and march in purple tights.
 King Richard Third would no more spring that old and honored spiel
 About “his kingdom for a horse!” but an <em>au</em>-to-mo-bile.
 Othello’d have to have a song, to sing in baritone,
 Like “The Sun Shines on Morocco or My Darling Desdemone”
 While Antony, of regal Cleopatra growing fond
 Might get a hand with his new song “My Gal’s a Strawb’ry Blonde.”
<p> &emsp; <strike>My gal is a Strawb‘ry blonde
 She sure has got me conned
 &emsp; She’s <span class="unclear" title="Certainly mistranscribed; resembles “wake” or “mab—”">Mark’s</span> own Cleopat
 &emsp; Jes’ bet on dat
 Fo’ my gal is a strawb’ry blonde</strike>
