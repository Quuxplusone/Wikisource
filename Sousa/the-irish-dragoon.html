<p>This page contains fragments of Joseph W. Herbert and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta
<i>The Irish Dragoon</i>, transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).

<p>According to Paul E. Bierley’s 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/worksofjohnphili00bier/page/29"><i>The Works of John Philip Sousa</i></a>,
Sousa purchased Joseph Herbert’s libretto to <i>The Irish Dragoon</i> — based on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lever">Charles Lever’s</a>
1841 novel <i>Charles O’Malley, the Irish Dragoon</i> — which included at least some music
composed by another composer, but then set that music aside and composed his own.
“The operetta was to have been produced in October 1915,” writes Bierley, based on
<a href="./clippings/the-irish-dragoon.html">a press release</a>
from May 16, 1915; but in fact it never made it to a theater. Sousa’s holograph scores, discovered in 1965,
indicate that Sousa was still working on it off and on through 1916 and perhaps 1917. Sousa “made
an unsuccessful attempt to revive the operetta in the late 1920s” with libretto by Bennett Chapple,
but it’s unclear whether that libretto was ever completed; if so, whether it survives in any form;
and whether Sousa wrote any more music than the fragments surviving here.

<p>Meanwhile, by November 1915 a production titled <i>The Irish Dragoon</i> was being staged
by E. E. Pidgeon at the Lyceum Theatre in New York, starring Andrew Mack, with a book by
Theodore Burt Sayre.

<p>Bierley lists as his source “Opa 384pp inc; overture dated 17Jul1915 np [LC].”
I haven’t seen anything fitting that description.
The lyrics below are collected from holograph score fragments located in the Sousa papers in
the Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 138 folders 6–12; box 240 folder 9). Some of the scores are in
Sousa’s hand; some are in a different hand. Notably the cockfighting scene (SA012) contains lyrics
in both hands, as Sousa modifies the first composer’s work.

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

 &emsp; In the dear old days of long ago,
 They traveled from the East and halted here upon their way,
 &emsp; In the dear old days of long ago.
 The genie of the island met them when they landed here;
 He bid them honest welcome and he gave them hearty cheer.
 He gave unto the Englishman a piece of gold, they say;
 The Scot he got <span class="unclear" title="SA008. Very clearly not “an oatcake,” but I have no idea what this might be, if transcribed correctly">a catcake</span>, and he went upon his way;
 &emsp; While Barney, who was left alone,
 &emsp; The genie gave to him a stone.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Ochone, ochone!
 Ochone, ochone!
 Ochone, ochone!
<p><span class="left sc">Norah</span> But the stone he gave to Barney,

 Everyone believes each yarn he tells
 Since the dear old days of long ago.

 It contained the gift of blarney.
 And all believe each yarn he tells

 &emsp; Since the dear old days of long ago.
 The Scotsman has broad acres, he has flocks and herds beside,
 &emsp; Since the dear old days of long ago.
 While Barney is as poor as when he landed on this isle;
 His riches are a minus; wealth his touch does not defile.
 But the gift that was his stone to him for riches will atone—
 No fortune, but content, he found, went with the Blarney Stone.
 &emsp; So Barney, who was left alone,
 &emsp; Is happy with his Blarney Stone.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Ochone, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> When an Irishman has kissed the Blarney Stone,
 There’s nothing can resist his oily tone.
 &emsp; All in vain is your defense—

<p> In this land ’neath the southern skies
 Where the maidens have wondrous eyes
 A coquette, cigarette, then a loving duet—
 In the net you forget one you adore.
 Then the old love forever dies;
 Señor Cupid has won the prize;
 And you get a brunette with such lovely eyes of jet
 You regret you hadn’t met before.
