<p><span class="sc">One</span> picks up ’most any present-day magazine and opens it to a featured poem or article by
Ella Wheeler Wilcox. The subject is usually something of vital interest at the moment:
child labor, divorce, the war. The viewpoint is humanitarian, yet not propagandic. It tells
the other side of the story so simply and straightforwardly as to carry absolute conviction.

<p>The daily newspaper somewhere within its pages carries similar poems and articles.
Sometimes they set forth new thought and sometimes they are just help and encouragement,
meant to lift heavy hearts above the din of strife.

<p>Whatever the subject, it is impossible to estimate the influence that the author
is wielding. It is impossible to be thoroughly in earnest and not convince.
Therefore it is as though she spoke personally into thousands of ears every day.
Which privilege is the ambitions of years and years ago fulfilled. No life could
have been more circumscribed, no limits narrower than were hers in the beginning.

<center>***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;</center>

<p><span class="sc">Ella Wheeler Wilcox,</span> first called the “Poetess of Passion,” and later, by her friends,
the “Poetess of Purpose,” was born in a little home on the Wisconsin prairie, a dozen miles
from a town and five miles from a post-office. Most of her early education was
picked up from stray books, with the help of her mother and older sisters. The
important part of her training, however, was acquired alone from the wind as it
sang over the rolling spaces, the light in the evening sky, the rain marching like
a gray army before her eyes. And hers was the miracle of expression. When
she was a little girl of eight she wrote stories and verses. She seemed gifted
with a natural sense of rhythm and word values. It was inevitable that she should
write for the joy of writing.

<p>When she was fourteen she saw her name in print for the first time. A little
local fame came her way then, bringing pain rather than happiness. For it meant
criticism, and the least unfavorable comment always plunged her into depths of
darkest despondency. Praise accordingly lifted her to the heights, so she began to
live an existence of moods and acutely developed emotionalism. She greeted
every new day with exhilarating expectancy; a peculiar spiritual egotism led her
to look for special dispensations of Providence in her behalf—a sort of setting
aside of nature’s laws and a violating of reason’s codes that she might be cared
for. All about her was the deadly monotony of the commonplace, yet she ever
looked for the romantic to occur. This exalted state of the imagination cast a
glow around a time that otherwise would have been lonely, troubled, and difficult.

<p>Such concentration of anticipation brought result. Unusual things did
happen. And the imagination magnified them and made them seem like so many
shining crowns of happiness. Every commonplace thing took on a guise of rare
loveliness; between what was happening, what she believed had happened, and
what she expected to happen, the world widened. And through all pulsed the
deep consciousness of the wonder of life and the enjoyment of it.

<p>Years afterward Mrs. Wilcox said that the versatile quality of her mind which
made it possible for her mood to shift suddenly from gloom to glory was better
than a million-dollar dower, even though it caused her to place exaggerated values
on things and events—to water her own stock and find it worthless when offered
to her later judgment for sale.

<p>At the University of Wisconsin a new aspect of life opened. She began to
earn money, and the satisfaction of being helpful to the family brought her
new happiness. She was the youngest of four, and there were nephews and
nieces to assist, as well as need of money in the homes of brothers and sisters.
Perhaps there was just a bit of vanity in her unselfishness: a pride in being looked
upon as an equal by her elders. If there were vanity it brought its own punishment,
for her nature was of the type to be wounded by any suggestion of lack of
appreciation. When she had become more balanced by experience she wrote:
“To look for any return—even gratitude from another—changes benevolence to
barter and sale. To do good for good’s sake and to think no more about it,
believing the seed will grow into a harvest of goodness for the world—that alone
brings happiness.”

<center>***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;</center>

<p><span class="sc">Then</span> came the hour which brought Mrs. Wilcox the conviction
that her talent meant influence and responsibility. It suddenly became dignified
as she reasoned that instead of being merely a helper in the home she must
become a helper in the world. To mold thought, guide conduct, and sustain purpose—these
were to be her duties; humanity was to be her family and all men and women her kin.

<p>About this time she began to be sought by lion-hunters from Madison, Milwaukee,
St. Louis, and Chicago. The lure of city life and its pleasures threatened to
drown the voice of ambition. But after taking stock of the situation she decided
that there were three ways out: to curtail her enjoyment of city life, lessen
her helpfulness to others, or increase her income. The latter course seemed the
logical one, permitting her to follow inclination as well as duty. Accordingly
she went to work literally to mill short stories, poems, essays. Nine out of every
ten went back and forth between her home and New York at least a dozen times before
they finally found the haven of a purchaser. And slowly but steadily her income
increased. It was a hard fight, with the world on one side and her pen on the other.
She made mistakes and suffered from lack of judgment, often running into by-paths
and blind alleys in her eagerness to push quickly along the highroad of progress.

<p>Marriage in 1884 took her to the wonderful land of her dreams—the east. It
seemed then as though highest ambitions were being realized. She had time for
study and reading and for physical culture. She entertained at her winter
home in New York and her summer home on Long Island sound, many whose names alone
had brought happiness into the old life. Existence grew richer as time flew along;
the breadth and enchantment for which she had longed as a girl were hers; the desire
to bring something of confidence and peace to others was beginning to be realized.

<center>***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;</center>

<p><span class="sc">That</span> those who have always been ready to discourage,
criticize and question her viewpoint were only a part of her development is the
firm belief of Mrs. Wilcox. That they were placed along her way for the purpose
of saving her from the evil of self-complacency is her further conviction.
Though assured that all she might say had already been said by great writers,
she wrote on, thinking that she had her own personal message for the world.
Though told that her poetry was merely versification and her prose platitudes,
ranking only as third place in literature, she wrote on, determined to do her very
best as a writer of third magnitude. It seemed to her that life was too big,
feeling too intense, time too short to trouble about what a few seemed to believe,
especially as there was an appreciative and ever-increasing audience for her.

<p>“I expected much of life; it has given, in all ways, more than I expected,” is
what she has to say now, looking back upon a long life of usefulness.

<p>Her last work has been playwriting. With the assistance of Ruth Helen Davis,
Mrs. Wilcox completed an allegory, “Victory,” the idea of which was suggested
by the world war. It was produced for the first time recently at the Toy theater,
Boston, opening the season at that pretty little playhouse to a large and
fashionable audience.

<p>“Victory” is described by the critics as a cheerful little fairy tale based upon
a variation of the old story of the princess endowed by all the fairies at her
birth, including one evil spirit who wasn’t invited. As Miss Davis willed it,
the princess is kidnaped by the evil spirit, Amour Propre, and rescued by the
hero, Disinteresso, after a realistic sword fight with the demon.

<p>There are about one hundred actors in the play and thirty-two speaking parts,
so Mrs. Wilcox’s beautiful lyrics, with their lofty sentiment, are delivered as
she probably hoped to hear them. Although there is no singing, there is much
incidental music, including a motif by Arthur Foote, which recurs frequently.
A group of fairies dance attractively. Ruth Helen Davis plays an important role.

<p>The play was first given a tryout at “The Anchorage,” the magnificent estate
of Mrs. Simon Baruch, regent of the Daughters of the Revolution, at Long
Branch, N.&nbsp;J. It will probably be played throughout the principal cities
of the United States.

<center>***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;***&emsp;</center>

<p><span class="sc">Although</span> she is sixty-two years old, Mrs. Wilcox has the freshness
and beauty of a girl. Her golden hair is just beginning to be shot with gray,
her spotted brown eyes are timid and appealing as a child’s and her cheeks
tinted with pink. Many and wide are her interests, and in an hour’s talk she
touches upon most of the matters that are making history today. Her philosophy
of life she states in a few words.

<p>“I have gone my way alone,” she says in her gentle voice. “I found my road
and walked it alone and I’m glad I did. And, looking back, every sorrow, every
unfaithfulness, has been worth while, because it taught me not to lean on human
appreciation, and not to work for gratitude and applause; that the pleasure of
doing work was its reason.

<p>“This, my philosophy of life, to make the very utmost of myself, my possibilities,
and my environment as a woman. And I never want to be anything else but a woman,
because it’s a glorious thing to be.

<p>“The rapid rush of the years passing by have made me realize how much I
could have done had I but realized that they were mine, but perhaps that, too,
was not possible. My failures have led me to this realization.

<p>“So many girls and women write me, praying for my influence to make them
successful writers. They don’t need help. It lies in oneself. Given certain
ideals, aspirations, ambitions, never lose sight of the fact that you have it in yourself.

<p>“Take an inventory of your possibilities and probabilities. A pygmy in stature
should not aim to play the role of an Amazon, but should have the resolution
to make herself the most complete and powerful pygmy in the world. But
a pygmy should not delude herself into thinking herself big, for self-obsession
will make her always mediocre.

<p>“The young woman starting out must not take too seriously the praise of the
world. My idea of the purpose of life is not to have power, fame or wealth, but
to give back to the creator those talents bestowed upon me improved and perfected,
and whoever does that has influence on other lives for good, and who attains
to worth-while success, her spirit is enlarged.”
