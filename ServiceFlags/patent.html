<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_I._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</a>:</i>
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address the House for two minutes.
<p>[<i>No objection.</i>]
<p><i>Mr. Emerson:</i> Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House, on my house in Cleveland hangs a service flag given me
by Capt. R. L. Queisser, the designer of this flag.
<p>The flag may be of any size, with a red border and a white center, with stars in the center to indicate the number
from that household or place of business that are in the service of the United States during this war.
<p>This service flag has been adopted by Hon. Harry L. Davis, mayor of Cleveland, the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce,
East Cleveland City Council, and by the governor of Ohio. The flag is displayed in many homes and factories in Cleveland
and all over the United States.
<p>The Cleveland Trust Co. and the Guardian Trust Co., two of the largest banks in Cleveland, have this service flag
displayed. There is nothing to do but to have Congress ratify what has been accepted by the people of this country as
a proper service flag.
<p>I am certainly proud of the fact that my only son is now in the service of the United States, not as an officer but
as a private. I know that every family in Cleveland and all over the United States that have a member of the family in
the service would be proud to display this flag. The Government should give one to every family that have sons or
daughters in the service.
<p>In these closing days of this extra session let us pass this resolution and give the fathers and mothers of this
country, who give their sons and daughters freely to this great cause, some recognition, so that the world may know
as it passes those families who gave to this great cause of liberty. We give a button to those who buy a liberty bond.
Why not give a flag to those who are willing to give their own flesh and blood; the dearest thing in all the world
to a father and mother—their children? [Applause.]

<blockquote>
<p>A resolution introduced in the last Congress by Representative Emerson, but upon which no action
was taken by Congress, as was noted in <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_armed-forces-journal_1917-11-03_55_10/page/360">our issue of Nov. 3, page 360</a>,
proposed an appropriation to provide “service flags” of the type designed, the resolution stated,
“by Capt. R. L. Queisser, of Cleveland”—a flag with a red border, a white center, and a star for
each member of a family or employee in U. S. Service. The Cleveland Plain Dealer of Nov. 18 says:
“Flag makers in all parts of the United States yesterday were warned that Robert L. Queisser and
the United Service Flag Company, of Cleveland, have exclusive patent rights to the new service
flag adopted by thousands of employers and families, who have sent employees and relatives to
the Army or Navy. Mr. Queisser, designer of the service flag, is a former captain in the Ohio National Guard.
<p>“It was claimed by flag makers in Cleveland and other cities last night that Mr. Queisser,
through the United Service Flag Company, has demanded a royalty of ten per cent. on all flags
incorporating his design. Mr. Queisser confirmed this. ‘I am going to make the flag makers of
this country pay the American Red Cross a nice little pile of money before I am through,’ he
declared. ‘I have patented the design solely for that purpose. I have made arrangements by
which fifty per cent. of all royalties I receive on the service flag patent is to go to the
Ohio chapter of the Red Cross.’ Flag makers in Cleveland and other cities last night declared
they were unaware that the flag possessed patent rights, and said the profits did not permit
of payment of a ten per cent. royalty. Some of the firms, it was stated, already have taken
the matter up with patent agents in Washington and are awaiting their advice as to the position
of the trade. It was further declared that some of the larger flag makers have been turning out
service flags by thousands, and that the royalties involved will run into several thousand dollars.”
<p>As to this Captain Queisser himself writes: “Being an ex-officer, I know what Red Cross work means
and therefore was glad to set aside fifty per cent. of our profits for Red Cross work. Let me add
that I never heard of any of those flag manufacturers that were recently called before a Congressional
investigating committee for advancing their prices for U.S. flags from 100 to 500 per cent. giving
fifty per cent. of their profits to any cause. We have two sons (both first lieutenants) in the Army
and it was with them in mind and that their mother might have a visible reminder of her sons that I
designed the Service Flag.”
<p>Inquiry at the Patent Office, the New York Times reports, showed that a design patent on a
service flag had been granted to L. Queisser <i>[sic]</i>, of Cleveland, Ohio, and notice of it printed in
the Patent Office Gazette of Nov. 6. To the same patentee was granted a patent on a watch fob
service flag design. It was said at the Patent Office that no other patent for a service flag
design had been granted. Report that the flag had been patented brought protests from flag dealers.
In a letter to the Times a Brattleboro firm said: “Our firm has been selling service flags for some time.
We are astonished to learn that this flag, adopted by the Government, recommended by the President,
and sold mostly to mothers whose sons are in the Service, should be the private monopoly of some individual.”
<p>The explanation was made at the Patent Office that a precedent for granting the design patent on a service
flag was found in the case of special flags for yachts or other ships, which were protected from infringement
by design patents. The statement was made that the Patent Office would not grant a design patent on any flag
based on the design of the American standard, but the service flag to show war service of individuals was
not regarded as following the design of the Stars and Stripes.
<p>The Patent Office is unwilling to pass upon the question whether any service flag similar in design
to that patented is protected by the patent design. That is a matter, it was said, which must be passed
upon by the courts.

<blockquote>
<p>The Service Flags, with their borders of red, their fields of
white, and their stars to indicate the number of those who have
gone into the military or naval service of the Government, have
blossomed out over so many buildings that they have rightly
become a matter of public interest and concern. Recent newspaper
reports that the present Service Flag had been patented
by a private individual have been circulated throughout the
country, and have caused no little discussion as to the exact
status of the flag which means so much to so many thousand
American homes.
<p>The records of the Patent Office show that these reports were
founded on fact, for on November 6, 1917, Design Patent
No. 51464 was granted to R. L. Queisser, of Cleveland, Ohio,
for “a flag with a red border, a white center field, and two blue
stars in the field.” Mr. R. L. Queisser was captain of the
Machine Gun Company of the Fifth Ohio Infantry during its
recent service on the border. He retired from the service just
before his regiment was mustered out of the Federal service
because of an injury received in an accident.
<p>When war was declared, he writes, in reply to a query
from us:
<blockquote style="font-size: 95%;">
<p class="head">The thought came to me that both of my sons who were still
officers in the Guard would again be called out, and I wondered
if I could not evolve some design or symbol by which it might
be known that they were away in their country’s service, and
which would be to their mother a visible sign of the sacrifice
her sons were making.
</blockquote>
<p>With this thought in mind he designed, with the advice of
some of his military friends, the flag which he recently patented.
He then suggested the use and distribution of this flag to the
Council of the city of East Cleveland (of which he is Vice-President),
and the Council passed an ordinance adopting it,
which provided that one flag should be presented to the family
of every soldier and sailor entering the service. The example
of East Cleveland was later followed by the city of Cleveland
and by the State of Ohio.
<p>A little later, he informs us, some of his friends suggested
that the design might be patented, and Mr. Queisser accepted
in their advice. The patent was granted, the royalty fixed at a low
figure, and an agreement made that half of all the net profits
should be set aside for the benefit of the Red Cross. Mr. Queisser
states that the campaign which resulted in introducing the
flag into common use cost him nearly two thousand dollars.
<p>Besides the benefit to the Red Cross and the possibility of
personal profit, Mr. Queisser states that he was led to take out
a patent in order that the distribution and quality of the flag
might be properly controlled, and that irresponsible flag-making
companies might not make undue profits from the sale of a flag
for which there was destined to be such tremendous demand.
<p>Some of the largest flag manufacturing concerns in the country
have taken out licenses to manufacture the flag, and have
agreed to subtract the license fee from their own profits rather
than to increase the price of the flag to the public.
<p>This is the story of the Service Flag as it comes to us from
its designer. Certainly no one can criticise the motives which led
Mr. Queisser to design a service flag, or his purpose in assisting
the Red Cross and also keeping the manufacture of his flag out
of the hands of irresponsible flag profiteers; but the acceptance
of a profit by a former army officer from the legal monopoly of
such a flag seems to us to be in the same category as the making
of profit by a physician from the monopolizing of a medicine.
<p>It moreover seems to us distinctly improper that a patent
for a Service Flag should remain in the hands of any private
individual. Either the Government should buy the patent to
the present Service Flag outright or a new flag should be designed
by the Government itself. The Government is in a far
better position to control the quality and price of the Service
Flag than any individual can possibly be, no matter how
firmly based on legality may be the design patent granted to
that individual by the Government. If the Government should
buy Mr. Queisser’s rights, it could either license responsible flag
manufacturers at a nominal figure, or, if it were deemed better,
it could name a license fee large enough to bring in substantial
contributions either to the Government itself or to the same
organization to which Mr. Queisser intends to devote half of
his profit. A continuance of the present private monopoly of the
flag which means so much to America ought not to be tolerated.

<p><b>“Service Flag Design Patent.”</b>
In the <i>Jewelers’ Circular</i> <b>75</b>(18), 1917-11-28,

<blockquote>
<p class="head"><b>Jewelers and Flag Manufacturers Surprised That Government
Should Issue Exclusive Rights on Emblem.</b>
<p>Jewelers and flag manufacturers were surprised last week to learn that there
was a design patent on the so-called “service flag” consisting of a red border
surrounding a white field with blue stars, the latter indicating the number of
people who have entered the service of the United States from the house, firm
or family floating the emblem. The flag has been so universally used and generally
understood to be officially used that it was believed to be public property.
However, according to a notice sent out by a concern in Cleveland, which is
verified by the patent records, a design patent upon this design was granted
Nov. 6 to Robert L. Queisser, East Cleveland, for both flag and jewelry purposes.

<p>If this patent is valid and if the patentee has an exclusive right to the
emblem in question on flags, jewelry, buttons, etc., it is believed that an
injustice has been done to the public, to the flag manufacturers, and jewelry
manufacturers by the patent laws and the combination of circumstances that have
made the service emblem universally used. The emblem has been accepted publicly
and universally, because it was believed to be public property and the universal
way of telling of the enlistment of our boys into the Army in a manner approved
by our government and Army authorities. It was not accepted and used in the idea
that it was the design of an individual or a firm or that anyone would be given
the right to make money or collect tribute as a result of such an expression of
patriotism.

<p>To learn now when the service emblem has become universally used in flags
and jewelry that the emblem is not public property, but is a destgn owned and
controlled by one firm, causes distinct regret to say the least. The house
claiming royalties for the design may have an absolutely legal and proper
basis for its claim, but to the layman and patriot such a condition seems
to indicate a weakness in our patent laws in granting a monopoly on a design
that has been accepted by the people as a public and national insignia to
express certain conditions.

<p>Robert L. Queisser, designer of the service flag, is a former captain in
the Ohio National Guard. He was injured in an automobile accident at Detroit
on the return journey from the Mexican border and retired from the service
soon after the guardsmen returned to Cleveland.

<p>It was claimed by flag makers in Cleveland, O., and other cities, that
Mr. Queisser, through the United Service Flag Co., has demanded a royalty
of 10 per cent. on all flags incorporating his design.

<p>Mr. Queisser confirmed the announcement last night that he had been granted
patent rights to the design.

<p>“It is true,” he said, “that I have been granted a patent on the design of my
service flag, and it is also true that notice has been served on flag makers
that I shall exact a royalty of 10 per cent. on all flags manufactured.

<p>“I am going to make the flag makers of this country pay the American Red Cross
a nice little pile of money before I am through,” he declared. “I have patented
the design solely for that purpose.”

<p>“Ever since the beginning of the war, many flag manufacturers have been
reaping a veritable harvest on their product and now many are objecting because
they may be forced to pay a 10 per cent. royalty on this particular flag.

<p>“I have made arrangements by which 50 per cent. of all royalties I receive
on the service flag patent is to go to the Ohio Chapter of the Red Cross.

<p>“I have turned my books over to Ernst &amp; Ernst, public accountants,
and you may be sure that the Red Cross will get its 50 per cent.”

<p>The United Service Flag Co. was incorporated Oct. 25 under the laws of Ohio
with a capital of $1,000. The promoters, named in the articles of incorporation,
are Robert L. Queisser and James L. Vaughan.

<p>Flag makers in Cleveland and other cities declared they were unaware that
the flag possessed patent rights and said the profits did not permit of payment
of a 10 per cent. royalty.

<p>Some of the firms, it was stated, already have taken the matter up with patent
agents in Washington and are awaiting their advice as to the position of the trade.

<p>The explanation was made at the Patent Office, Washington, D. C., that a
precedent for granting the design patent on a service flag was found in the
case of special flags for yachts or other ships, which were protected from
infringement by design patents. The statement was made that the Patent Office
would not grant a design patent on any flag based on the design of the American
standard, but the service flag to show war service of individuals was not
regarded as following the design of the Stars and Stripes.

<p>The Patent Office is unwilling to pass upon the question whether any
service flag similar in design to that patented is protected by the patent
design. That is a matter, it was said, which must be passed upon by the courts.

<blockquote>
<p>The service flag design, so well known, which
has been formally accepted by the Government,
and about which there has been considerable
newspaper discussion over the fact that flag
makers paid a royalty to the patentee of the design,
was gotten up by Captain R. L. Queisser, of
Cleveland, formerly of the Fifth Ohio Infantry.
<p>Captain Queisser, in a recent interview, is reported
as having related the following incident
which led up to his designing the flag.
<p>“During the early part of last March,” said
Captain Queisser, “I was confined in bed following
an automobile accident near Fort Wayne,
Indiana, where I was stationed with the Fifth
Ohio Infantry. It was during my illness that I
was mustered out of service, due to the disability
caused by injuries received. I thought of some
visible signs for a mother to show that her son
was serving the country rather than have her feel
an emptiness about the house which would depress
her. A service flag then came to me and
after several days I evolved the design.
<p>“It was not long after that letters came to me
approving the design and its value to a family
symbolical of their sacrifice.”
<p>Captain Queisser said he received a small
royalty from the flag manufacturers, and half of
it was being contributed to the American Red
Cross.
<p>In connection with this, it is interesting to note
that George B. Hurd &amp; Co. have the sole rights
for the use of the service flag design for writing
papers and papeteries, and it is now being employed
on the sheets and covers of their Service note papeterie.

<blockquote>
<p>Captain L. Queisser <i>[sic]</i>, of Cleveland, has brought suit against
the Wagner, Gilger, Cohen <i>[sic: Cohn]</i> Company, of Cleveland, for selling
service flags and jewelry made by the Paye &amp; Baker Company,
of North Attleboro. Captain Queisser claims ownership of a
design for the service flag. The North Attleboro firm expresses
itself as little worried over the suit.
<p>The legal outcome will be watched to see if it brings a
test of the entire situation covering the service flag. According
to some in the trade, the idea is an old one and was first used
by Japan during the Russian war. When the United States
started into the war a Newport, R. I., man, who had read of
the Japanese service flags, worked out an idea and displayed a
flag which attracted attention from Boston and New York as
well as his home city.
<p>Captain Queisser is said to have registered a design in red,
white and blue with a specified number of stars.
<p>Variations of this have been frequent and suits have followed.
Many jewelry firms paid royalties to the captain and
he explained that part of the proceeds go to the Red Cross.

<p class="head"><b>Cleveland Jewelry Concern Fails to Fight Infringement Suit Brought by United
Service Flag Co. When Design Was Used on Watch Fobs</b>
<p><span class="sc">Cleveland, O.,</span> April 10.—The infringement
suit of the United Service Flag Co. of Cleveland holding patent rights to the
service flag design was brought to a close after the defendents, Wagner-Gilger-Cohn
Co., wholesale jewelers of Cleveland, consented to a decree for the plaintiffs.
<p>“Our interest in the case was so small that we let it go by default,” said W. H.
Cohn of the Wagner-Gilger-Cohn Co. “We did not have enough at stake in the suit to
make it worth while to make a test case out of it.”
<p>The evidence developed that only six dozen watch fobs were involved in the
case and the damages if assessed will not run over $2.
<p>The decree was handed down by Judge D. C. Westenhaver of the Federal Court
for the Northern District of Ohio. The decree established the fact that the United
Service Flag Co., assignee of Robert L. Queisser, patentee of the service flag design
is the legal holder of the patent “granted to said Robert L. Queisser for certain new,
original ornamental designs for watch fobs or similar articles,” covering the subject
matter involved. The decree took the form of an injunction as follows:
<p>“It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the defendent, its agents,
servants and workmen be and are hereby enjoined for the remainder of the term of
the life of said letters patent from further infringing the same and from manufacturing,
using or selling the said infringing device or any infringing devices containing
or embodying the same.” The complainant is also enabled to recover “from the said
defendent damages sustained in or by reason of said infringement as the profits, gain
or saving made or realized thereby together with costs,” to be assessed by B. C. Miller,
special master.
<p>As the defendant did not contest the suit it thereby falls short of being a test case
of the validity of the patent. When interviewed Captain Queisser, who is president
of the United Service Flag Co., stated that infringement suits had been started in
Federal courts in other parts of the country, but refused to state where. He said,
however, that he was about to leave for one of the places.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finis_J._Garrett">Mr. Garrett</a> advises to consider the criteria more carefully.
Treadway asks to table the motion for now. Garrett suggests to refer it to the Committee on Military Affairs.]</i>

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Walsh_(Massachusetts_politician)">Mr. Walsh</a>:</i>
Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I want to suggest to my colleague from Massachusetts
<i>[Treadway]</i> that, as I understand it, there is now no officially recognized service flag.
There happens to be pending before this House, as I understand it, a resolution or bill, introduced
by the gentleman from Nebraska <i>[Reavis]</i>, to have Congress provide a design for a service flag,
and I would suggest that, rather than have the resolution referred to the Military Affairs Committee,
my colleague from Massachusetts withdraw it until action is had upon the resolution of the gentleman from Nebraska.

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Frank_Reavis">Mr. Reavis</a>:</i>
Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I desire to call the attention of the House for just a moment
to the situation with reference to this service flag. The service flag that is in general use throughout
the Nation has been patented by an Army officer, Capt. R. L. Queisser, of Cleveland, Ohio, who is charging
for the use of this flag a royalty of 5 and 10 per cent of the wholesale price. This Army officer has pretended
to assign this patent to what is known as the Service Flag Co., of Cleveland, Ohio. The stationery of that company
has but one name on it, and that is the name of the president, who, by the way, is the officer who patented the
flag. It is merely a pretended assignment for the reason that the patentee and the company are one and the same
person. I think there should be something in our connection with this war so altogether worthy that the profiteer
should be made to keep his hands off of it. [Applause.] The mothers of America are hanging this flag in their
windows as a sort of holy sacrament, as an expression of the pride that they feel in contributing a son to the
service of the Republic. That anyone, especially an Army officer, should exact from them a royalty is nothing
short of contemptible. I have pending before the Judiciary Committee a resolution calling for the adoption of
a service flag which shall be known as the national service flag, upon which no patent shall be granted. I would
not like to see this House indicate its pride in the Members who have gone to the service by hanging any flag
upon these walls upon which we have to pay a royalty before we may use it. [Applause.] I would like to see this
resolution withdrawn until the Judiciary Committee can report in proper form some legislation, either by resolution
or such amendment as may suit its pleasure, looking to the adoption of some design as a national service flag which
the homes of America may use without charge, because I am tired of seeing the devotion and the patriotism of the
parents of this Nation coined into money for the benefit of the profiteer. [Applause.]

<p><i>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Stafford">Mr. Stafford</a> asks leave to speak.]</i>
<p><i>Mr. Stafford:</i>
Mr. Speaker, last November my attention was called to the fact that this captain in the Army to whom the gentleman
from Nebraska <i>[Reavis]</i> refers, and who has been given considerable prominence in this House by a resolution
introduced by the gentleman from Ohio <i>[Emerson]</i> to provide $50,000 for the purchase of this service design
to be displayed in the homes of families whose sons have enlisted under the colors, had begun proceedings against
manufacturers of these generally used service flags. I received the information from a patent attorney who was
representing some of these manufacturers who had manufactured flags without authority from the inventor of the
design. He advised me that the head of the division of designs in the Patent Office had made a finding adverse
to the granting of the patent for the design, but that in his absence on a vacation some subordinate or other
official had authorized the patent. This patent attorney is contesting the position of this Army officer who
is claiming 5 per cent royalty on all flags manufactured before the issuance of the design patent, and 10 per cent
royalty, 5 per cent for himself and 5 per cent for the Red Cross, on all flags manufactured thereafter. It is a
question that is going to be contested, because many manufacturers are being besieged with claims by this person
who has obtained this design patent really with the disapproval of the head of the Design Division that had it in charge.
<p>True, he has a patent; but I approve the position taken by the gentleman from Nebraska that we should not go ahead
and grant authorization by congressional action of a design which the claimed originator is using for collecting money
from innocent users.

<p><i>[Further procedural comments from Reavis, Treadway, and Walsh.]</i>

<p><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Gard">Mr. Gard</a>:</i>
Would not it solve all the difficulty if the gentleman from Massachusetts would withdraw the resolution?

<p><i>Mr. Treadway:</i> Mr. Speaker, we have already taken too much time on a matter that I thought
would not take any time, and I withdraw the resolution for the present.
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this, on page 742:

<blockquote>
By Mr. TREADWAY: Resolution (H. Res. 217) instructing the Clerk of the House to secure
a service flag; to the Committee on the Judiciary.

<blockquote>

<p>And in thls connection, Mr. Speaker, I also wish to call attention to the fact
that the flag back of the Speaker’s rostrum is not the official flag of the United
States. The stars in that flag are of gilt and should be of plain white. There is
no authority for the use of gilt stars in the official flag of this country.

<p><b>“The Service Flag Again.”</b>
In <i>The Outlook</i> <b>118</b>(6), 1918-02-06,
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092810639&seq=228">page 204</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>A brief history of the Service Flag published in The Outlook
of December 26, 1917, has brought us many letters heartily
commending The Outlook’s statement that the ownership of the
Service Flag should not be left in private hands.
<p>One of the heartiest letters of approval which we have re-
ceived comes from Mr. George Winant Parks, of Providence,
Rhode Island. Mr. Parks says in his letter:
<blockquote style="font-size: 95%;">
<p class="head">As a reader of The Outlook I wish to subscribe to the stand
you have taken regarding the ownership of the Service Flag.
While we all appreciate the thought and timely suggestion of
Mr. Queisser, who designed and first used the Service Flag, the
consensus of opinion of the American people would undoubtedly
be against its being owned and controlled by any one individual,
and especially opposed to its being a source of money-making to
such a one. As an emblem it stands second in patriotism to the
Stars and Stripes, and should belong, as the flag does, to the
people. In so far as I know, The Outlook is the only publication
that has taken such a stand, which is not a surprise to its readers,
who have long since realized that the paper always aims to
stand for right and justice and true patriotism. Since Mr. Queisser
is going to divide the income with the American Red Cross,
possibly he would be willing to sell his rights and patent to that
organization for an amount to cover his cost, etc., which he says
is about $2,000.
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Parks further suggests that a fund be raised by public
subscriptions of one dollar each on behalf of the Red Cross to
reimburse Mr. Queisser for his expenditures in promoting the
use of his Service Flag, and that the patent monopoly, which
he at present holds, be given to the Red Cross.
<p>Purchased in such a way, the patent on the Service Flag could
then be given to the public outright or used as a means for
raising further funds for the Red Cross. Certainly this suggestion
appears to offer one excellent way to remove the present
stigma from the Service Flag.
<p>We wish that Mr. Queisser might see fit to accept this suggestion
in the spirit in which it was offered. But with the testimony
before us we doubt whether he will. In a letter recently received
from Mr. Queisser he states that he would be willing to sell his
patent to the Government “at a price, however, for which it is
worth.” Mr. Queisser deplores the continued discussion of the
ownership of the Service Flag in the following words:
<blockquote style="font-size: 95%;">
<p class="head">Just now it seems to be working out fine and there is practically
 no comment because most of the manufacturers are working
under license and there is no reason for them to stir it up. The
amount of the license fee is so small that individually it practically
affects no one who buys a single flag, and I believe the fact
is if the fee were reduced by the Government, if they purchased
the patent, that it would absolutely bring about no reduction
whatever in the sale price of the flags, and the license fee, fifty
per cent of which goes to the Red Cross, would be lost, and no
one but the manufacturer be the gainer.
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, if the Nation continues to permit the
symbol of its patriotism to be exploited for private profit, the
country as a whole will be the loser in self-respect. Which
alternative is preferable?

<blockquote style="font-size: 95%;">
<p><span class="sc"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_T._Herrick">President Herrick</a></span> said: “<i>[...]</i>
I would like to call upon
a member of this Society, a new member who does not know
that he is to be called upon. But before I do so, I would
like to call your attention to this Service Flag. Over fifty
members of this Society have entered the service and you will
note at the top the two golden stars. The record of this
Society is one, I am sure, we are proud of and I think in all
seriousness, after the pleasantries about the treasury, that we
would all have been very much ashamed if we had not contributed
liberally from this treasury for war purposes. The
gentleman whom I desire to call upon is a new member; I believe
he is from Cleveland. You will recall that from Cleveland the
carrier system came,— the citizens of Cleveland
suggested and inaugurated a carrier system; also a citizen of
Cleveland designed the mail catchers in the early days.
Now, Robert L. Queisser has designed the Service Flag which
has been in evidence in the windows of homes throughout this
land and I should be pleased to have him stand up and say
a few words, if he will. (Applause.)
<p><span class="sc">Mr. Queisser</span> said:
“Mr. President and gentlemen of the
Ohio Society. This is as the honored president has said;
I came here tonight at the solicitation of my friend Mr. Ditto
<i>[Peter W. Ditto, chair of the membership committee]</i>,
expecting to take a back seat at some little table. Imagine
my surprise and the shock to my nervous system when I found
that I had been delegated to sit at the table of the president
in this distinguished company. And then, to cap the climax,
to be asked to say something without any preparation, and I
feel like the answer of the boy when he was asked: ‘Does your
sister sing?’ He said: She does, but she can’t.’ (Laughter.)
A year ago this month one of the distinguished pastors
of the City of New York in
<a href="./over-the-top.html">a sermon</a> which he preached, said
that to his mind the conception of the Service Flag was distinctly
an inspiration from on high,— and he being a member
of the cloth, of course, I cannot take any exception to what
he said. (Laughter.) If that be so, there is no credit
particularly due and I have only been the instrument that has
caused the production of the thought which has given to the
people of this country that flag which has solaced the hearts
of wives and the mothers and the sisters and the women of
this country, not to forget that it has made proud the hearts
of the fathers and those who have sent their best beloved into
the service. If the invention or the institution of this flag
has been of any value, I am immensely repaid.
<p>“Hundreds of poems have been written about this flag and
one woman poured out her heart in these lines:
<div class="poem" style="font-size: 92%;"><p>“A square of red, a strip of white,
&emsp; One little star of blue,
Is hanging beside the doorway
&emsp;That is home for me and you.
<p>Our boy has gone, he is over there,
&emsp; He is all we had to give,
Our only son scarce twenty-one,
&emsp; He had just begun to live.
<p>We are lonesome now, and when last night
&emsp; I laid my knitting up,
I sobbed a silent prayer for him
&emsp; While gazing at the sky.
<p>Great Saturn shone, Vega blazed in glory,
&emsp; But I know the heavens do not own an orb so great
As that one star of blue.”
</div>
<div class="rightdiv">(Applause.)</div>
<p>“Some have been good enough to say that the Service Flag
has been a potent factor in engendering a better and a more
willing feeling of sacrifice. That it has been the symbol,— the
visible symbol of those who have given themselves and
offered themselves on the altar of human liberty. Not only
that, but it represents those who have sacrificed everything
in going to the front and offering themselves in their ideal
of world democracy. It has been a great pleasure to me during
the past year in the travels that I have had throughout
this country to see that flag in practically every city and hamlet
through which I passed, and I am, perhaps, taking into
consideration what the good reverend said in this city, that
it was an inspiration, more proud of one fact: I offered
that flag,— I went to Washington, offered it to the government,
was ridiculed, told it had absolutely no merit, that it would
have no place in the annals of the war department, and in the
face of the utmost discouragement, with my good wife to
help me, I started on a six months’ propaganda. The result
is self-apparent; I put it across. (Applause.)
<p>“I feel that, perhaps, some of you men would care to see
the first flag that ever flew; I expect to show it Sunday night
in a church in this city, so that some day in the future you
can say you had,— I do not know whether you would call it
the pleasure,— but there is the first flag. (Applause.) I
appreciate the opportunity of being here tonight and I want
to express my thanks to my good friend Ditto in insisting
I place my application with you. I assure you I shall go
away from here with the happy appreciation of a very pleasant
evening spent in the company of ex-Ohioans." (Long applause.)
<p><span class="sc">Mr. Kennedy</span> said:
“May I just say one word? The
two stars on that flag are the captain’s only sons who were
among the earliest volunteers. He did not mention that.”
(Applause and cheers.)
