<p>This is Wilson J. Vance and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>Katherine</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The dialogue and lyrics are mostly as they appear in the libretto
printed by R. O. Polkinhorn in 1881, a copy of which resides in the
Vance Family Papers at Bowling Green State University (MS 1184, box 2).
Manuscript lyrics are found in the Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 241 folders 1–3).

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

<span class="sc">Clothilde</span>, and <span class="sc">Smith</span></span> among a
<span class="sc">Chorus of Tourists</span>, divided into

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Chorus
<p><span class="left sc">Pess.</span> Why, nothing could be plainer
 Than that ’tis sure to rain or
 Snow; it was never known to
 &emsp; Happen otherwise.
 When for the closing pastime
 We plan a jolly last climb
 Then it was always known to!
 &emsp; Just look up at the skies!
<p><span class="left sc">Opt.</span> Oh no; you are mistaken,
 For, see, the clouds are breaking;
 ’Tis time that we were making
 &emsp; Our minds up what to do.
 The day is fast advancing;
 The shadows will be glancing;
 And we’ll come home by moonlight
 &emsp; Unless we quickly go.
<p><span class="left sc">Pess.</span> But see, the clouds are massing—
<span class="left sc">Opt.</span> Oh no they’re not; they’re passing—
<span class="left sc">Pess.</span> We’ll have a shower in half an hour,
 &emsp; Just mark now what we say.

Who does not do that, pray?

<p><span class="left sc">Wyv.</span> Now, I have looked up Vennor;
 He’s always within ten or
 A dozen days of any storm
 &emsp; That strikes this hemisphere.
 He says unless it’s raining
 We’ll have the sun a-shining;
 He’s positive the day will
 &emsp; Be cloudy or be clear!
<p><span class="left sc">Pess.</span> Last night the frogs were croaking
 And all the chimneys smoking,
 And don’t you know ’tis always so
 &emsp; When a thunder-storm is brewing?
<p><span class="left sc">Smith</span> In truth I’d always rather
 When I require weather,
 Accept what is American
 &emsp; Than any other kind.
 “Old Prob’s” will do for me, sir,
 While Vennor is, you see, sir,
 A foreign-born dictator—
 &emsp; I’ll take the home-spun wind.
<p><span class="left sc">Opt.</span> There’s nothing more provoking
 Than to hear such foolish croaking—
 &emsp; Nine times in ten
 &emsp; It comes just when
 We would be pleasure-going!
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> Now, what we want is some one—
 Some one much more than human—
 &emsp; To suit us all,
 &emsp; Both spring and fall,
 With the right kind of weather!
 And we are sure that Congress
 Deliberately wrong us;
 &emsp; If they were wise
 &emsp; They would devise
 A plan—something or other!

<p> Ah, that a maid should be forlorn

 Though her charms be fresh as morn

 There is a mine of hidden wealth

 And I am sure it’s not by stealth

<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> That horrid monster—
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Oh my! Oh my! Oh goodness gracious!
<span class="left sc">Clo.</span> Came at me with his jaws wide open!
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Oh my! Oh my! Oh goodness gracious!

<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> Another moment—I scarce can say it—
 Another moment and I would have been devoured!

 And seized the bear by his awful—

<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; By his awful tail!
<p><span class="left sc">Clo.</span> &emsp; Oh, my heart is beating so,

 Oh! That scene! It is too awful for re-painting!
 &emsp; Oh, my blood ran slow and cold
 &emsp; As I thought he would enfold
 In his grasp so fierce and strong—yes, enfold and hold me grimly.
 &emsp; Then I meekly closed my eyes,
 &emsp; For I was the monster’s prize,
 Ah, the agony was long—and my life seemed slipping from me!
<p> &emsp; Then there came a manly form;
 &emsp; Quick he snatched me from the harm
 That hung o’er me like an awful threat’ning horror.
 &emsp; Springing like a thunderbolt
 &emsp; To the dreadful fierce assault—
 Ah, the sight but added to my shrinking terror!
 &emsp; Thus was Heaven kind to me:
 &emsp; A protector prompt to see,
 In a vise-like grip of steel seized the mastodonic monster.
 &emsp; Coming on the fearful scene
 &emsp; And with courage high, serene—
 Oh, the gratitude I feel—saved me from impending danger!
<p><span class="left"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>recit.</i>]</span> And yet I am not proud;

<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Naught can save the victim of his wrath!
<span class="left sc">Wyv.</span> I’ve earned quite a reputation as a gallant;
 &emsp; I shrink from neither fear nor pain;
 And at saving lovely women I’ve a talent—
 &emsp; None ever called upon me in vain.
 For you see—
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; For you see—
<span class="left sc">Wyv.</span> I hold the man an arrant knave
 &emsp; Who flies from woman’s tears;
 Who, while his strength might beauty save,
 &emsp; Consults his coward fears.
 I can no more restrain myself

 Than thatch can shield the peasant elf
 &emsp; When Alpine av’lanche falls.

<span class="db">[<i>Catching sight of <span class="sc">Kate</span></i>]</span>
Ah, there old Gobbler’s daughter. Why not, Lucius, my boy? Things are dull here,
and a little affair wouldn’t be bad! She looks sentimental. Suppose I carol her
a love ditty, sad and strong?— I’ll try it.

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Lucius</span>
<p> Sad is the heart where love dwells not—
 &emsp; Where, desolate and drear,
 Affection weaves no bright spells that
 &emsp; Drive out all anxious fear!
 The morn brings to that cheerless breast
 &emsp; No joyous gleam of hopeful grace;
 In dewy eve there is no rest
 &emsp; Shut out from Love’s sweet face.
<p> Is there not in all this great world
 &emsp; Some one to bless my life?
 Some one to cheer this barren heart
 &emsp; And end this weary strife?
 And must I wander, loveless, on?
 &emsp; And, hopeless, fare the darksome day?
 Still must I sing my lonely song
 &emsp; And faint for love away?

“—Some one to caress”? Then take me! Here I am, “free-born and of full age,”

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
What? Your face? Well, I should say so.

Ahem! “Lucius” will do,

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

two or three at once—and—

me Katie, won’t you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Indeed I will.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
For Pa, you know, says I was christened Katherine, when I wasn’t; for I guess I know,

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Must have been. But never fear, I’ll always call thee Katie, for though
by any other name you’d— no, I mean— I never will cease to love thee!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
When we calmly look back at it, isn’t it strange?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Undoubtedly. To what do you refer? What has struck you as peculiarly strange?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
How we love each other so deeply, truly, and fondly—and to think I was wanting a sweetheart

But how will that help me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
Why, if you make a fuss and worry him about <em>his</em> love affair, he will be glad

Oh, Lottie, do you think—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
If he won’t let you love your sweetheart, don’t let him love his! That will bring him to terms.

 Though the arrow that’s flying e’en may strike you or me

<p class="who">Serenade—<span class="sc">Lucius</span>
<p> When Love hangs his lamp in the evening sky,
 &emsp; And the glow-worm dimly shows his light;
 When the stars come out soft-faced and shy
 &emsp; To herald the coming night;
<p> When the lilies fold their petals close
 &emsp; And the daisies hang their drowsy heads;
 When the dewdrop gems the drooping rose
 &emsp; And the violets rest in their beds;
<p> When the sea takes on an opal gleam
 &emsp; And the lulling tide ripples soft and low;
 When the fisherman’s song like enchantment seems
 &emsp; By the breeze tossed to and fro—
<p> ’Tis then that I walk and dream, and dream
 &emsp; Of the sweet life yet to be;
 And my darling’s face like an angel’s comes
 &emsp; To brighten the world to me!

Bravely sung, i’faith! And where gattest
thou yon ballad, gentle troubadour? By Saint Cupid, ’twere a soft and
touching one, and sweetly warbled! In good sooth, it went to my
heart like a healing balm and melted my obdurate hardness even as
the warm rays of the sun melt and dissolve the icy fetters of the
singing streamlet in the springtime! Where gattest thou it, sad minstrel?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>likewise</i>]</span>
Indeed, Mr. Jones, I feel that my poor
words can but feebly show my thanks for a compliment as beautiful
as it was unexpected and unmerited! What poor return my small abilities
may make is yours! I thank you!

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
I, too, soft songster, feel the inadequacy of my power to fitly
acknowledge thy delightful courtesy. Yet all that I have, fair youth, I
hasten to set forth to do thee honor. Words, noble warbler, are but idle
wind. I would fain do more. Will’t please thee enter mine humble
hostlery and beer a beer with me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Or would you deign to accept from me a neat but inexpensive
Limberger lunch? I need not say that there’s nothing small about me,
and, fragrant as your song is, I would be pleased to recompense you,
odor for odor.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Sure, never since the melancholy Montague swore soft oaths in the
willing Capulet’s drinking ear were love’s perjuries so sweetly sung
nor warmly welcomed. Now, by my halidom, I do love thee! That
last stave—couldst thou not sing the strain again?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
By all means, Mr. Jones! Just throw back your little head and
swell out your little throat, and sing your little heart right out, do!

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Ah, I do beseech thee, valiant knight—

<p>[<span class="sc">Lucius</span>, upon realizing his mistake, has placed
his back to a rock or a tree and listened quietly.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
When you fellows get through monkeyin’

The joke’s on me. Spare me any more of your incomparable wit.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Indeed, sir, I’m quite certain that had Katherine heard your
song she—being now but badly smitten—would be wildly mad with love
for a singer so accomplished.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>dryly and coolly</i>]</span>
Thank you, sir. You’re too kind.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
I say, Jonesy, teach me that song, and while I may not hope to
rival you in voice, I’ll wager my patrimony I’ll gain my hard-hearted
mistress before the end of the second verse. And the ravishing plaintiveness
of it all— by Jove, it would melt the heart of a marble Venus.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Wouldn’t it, though?

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Teach me the lesson, that I, too, may— but here come the ladies.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
What dreadful words are these? Who has incurred your displeasure, Mr. Jones?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Nobody, madame. It was but a suppositious case. Here we
sat, a jury, charged to inquire whether the world had ever before contained
so fair a widow as one we wot of.
<span class="db">[<i><span class="sc">Clothilde</span> bridles with coy confusion</i>]</span>
We summed the case up, and brought in a verdict.

<p><span class="sc dr">Lot.</span>
And it was—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
It, undoubtedly, was. —Then, you see, madame, I was just saying that
any man who would dispute the verdict I would r-r-rend him limb from limb!
D’ye see?

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Oh! Mr. Wyvern—I’m sure you’re very kind, Mr. Jones—isn’t he, Mr. Wyvern?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>testily</i>]</span>
Oh, yes, he’s— he’s remarkably kind, Jones is.
<span class="db">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
—The confounded impertinent puppy! Does he propose to have every

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
How beautiful the moonlight aglow the rippling waters.

<p><span class="sc dr unclear" title="ROP: “Cot.”">Lot.</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
And how useful, too! Coming from the huts of the hardy fisherman

<span class="db">[<i>looking at <span class="sc">Lucius</span>, who scowls

—it takes away the appetite while it fans the fevered brow.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Oh! you horrid, unromantic man!

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Ah, ’tis sad, and yet ’tis so.
<span class="db">[<i>To <span class="sc">Lucius</span></i>]</span>
Stand forth, my romantic one! Now, here is he can appreciate the scene.
When he feels the moonlight on the waters, and sees the odorous breeze,
his soul goes forth in harmony with all that’s beautiful in nature.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
How sorry I am for you poor mortals made of common clay.
So lost to all the finer touches of a— of a—

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Speaking of touches, Mr.— ah— Jones, won’t you touch your guitar
and sing us something suggested by this lovely, soul-elevating scene?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Bidden by thee, even though I were <span class="unclear" title="ROP: “you”">a</span>

to <span class="sd">C.</span></i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
No, no, madame, I am as young as I ever was. Age cannot wither me, nor custom stale
my infinite variety. While I feel just as strong and young as ever, I know a great deal
more. I have therefore larger capacity for enjoyment of life—and, may I say, love!

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Why, Mr. Wyvern—well, Frederick, then, if you will insist upon my calling you so—why,
Frederick, you talk as if you were awfully, awfully old. I’m sure you don’t look old,
nor act old. <em>I</em> think that you are of just the right age—neither a giddy boy, nor a
worn-out old man.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
You have it right, Clothilde. I didn’t realize till I met you a few days ago,
however, how young I really am. Why, madame, I love like a three-year-old!
<em>You</em> have taught me the lesson.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
But you loved once before; you have been married.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Yes, I loved; but not with that fierce all-absorbing passion that I feel for you,
lovely one. I was too young; for I married at twenty; lived so for five years when my
wife died; and for the last fifteen years I have led the lonely unblessed life of
a widower, with no thought of loving again till I met you.
<span class="db">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
Lord! Lord! How a man will lie to a pretty woman!
I’m fairly surprised at myself.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
You love your daughter—

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
My darling, spoiled, fiery little Katie!
The poor child was left motherless at the age of twelve months; she is now but fourteen—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Clo.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
<em>She</em> says sixteen.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Great heavens! If she catches me in that—! What an ass I am, to tell her my wife
has been dead for fifteen years and that Kate is only fourteen! What a fool as
well as liar a man is, when he’s in love. But possibly she hasn’t seen it.
Her face looks unsuspecting.
<span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span>
I do love my little Katie, although this fiery change that has come over her
perplexes me. She used to tremble at my frown, and now she cares for it less
than for the sighing of the evening breeze.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Ah, sir, Love is a wizard, and works wonderful changes with a touch of his wand.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But what right has she, a school-girl in short dresses, to be thinking of love?
It’s preposterous!

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
But how old were you when you first fell in love, Frederick dear?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
I was— well, I scarcely think we need go into <em>that</em>. But I have
told you of myself; can you not give me a page from <em>your</em> life history,
Clothilde?

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Ah, sir, it can be told in a few brief words. Two years ago
I married one of the noblest of men—young, ardent, and generous to
a fault. He doted on me, and, I fear, spoiled me and made me unfit
to face the cold world. It was not a love match, for he was not handsome
and <i>distingué</i> as—as you are, Frederick; it was a match arranged
between our parents while I was yet at school. But he loved me passionately,
was wealthy and indulged my every wish, and I was happy;
but not happy as I am now in the knowledge of your love! But evil
days came. He lost all his property: and from grief, which sprung
alone, I am sure, from a feeling that he would have to deprive me of
some of the luxuries he was so fond of bestowing upon me, he faded
away. He died a year ago! And I am left a poor, lone widow, with
no friends, no manly arm to lean upon, no fond heart to cherish me,
no dear sympathy to brighten and soften my hard lot— Oh! You will
not think me foolish if I weep? I cannot help it!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>enfolding her in his arms</i>]</span>
Weep on, my stricken one! In point of fact, weep on this manly breast,
and let the throbbing of this heart of mine assure you that you are
no longer alone and friendless.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Oh, thank you, sir!

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
For the sake of peace, I must let Katie have her way—the absurd child—I suppose.

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Oh, Frederick, my own, in our great happiness, would it not be almost
impious in us to stand between her and her love?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Perhaps. But ere we go again to mingle with the gay and thoughtless throng
about us, tell me once more that you love me!

<p><span class="sc dr">Clo.</span>
Oh, my preserver, can you ask me—? Ought I not, rather, to ask you
to assure me of <em>your</em> love?

—Their feet, I mean; from the time they are quite young, my angel;
and that which we would consider a deformity, they esteem a mark of great beauty.

<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Kate</span>
<p> She sat amid the red, red roses there;
 The wanton wind toyed with her golden hair.
 &emsp; The wind swept from the south,
 &emsp; And, loving, kissed her mouth,
 And, loving, played amid her golden hair.
<p> His farewell said, the lover stood apart,
 And from his eyes looked forth his love-full heart.
 &emsp; Deep love-lit eyes of blue,
 &emsp; Love’s chosen color true—
 Should sorrow come to these? True love e’er part?
<p> &emsp; Lilies bowed their odorous heads;
 &emsp; Violets dreamed in their soft beds;
 &emsp; The rose-hearts flaunted gaudy red;
 &emsp; The sleepy daises waked and said:—
<p> &emsp; “Man’s love: what can we do?
 &emsp; “It lives and fades—
 &emsp; “We live and wither too!”
 &emsp; A love-bird, moaning, flew.
<p> The maiden fair toyed with a jewel rare;
 The fond youth kissed a lock of golden hair;
 &emsp; The pledges of their love,
 &emsp; Time’s cycling change to prove—
 But, loving thus, no dream of change was there!
<p> &emsp; The circling moon crept ’neath a cloud;
 &emsp; Love’s weakest oaths are oft too loud.
 &emsp; Was it <span class="unclear" title="Thus in ROP. Kildare has “the old story told”; 241/1 has “the old old story, fresh retold”">the old story fresh retold</span>—
 &emsp; Lies for the truth, and dross for gold?
<p> But soon the moon in bursting splendor bright
 Filled all the vale with flood of silver light,
 &emsp; Raised up young hearts low-cast;
 &emsp; Love’s light drove out the past,
 And all the future <span class="unclear" title="Thus in 241/1 and ROP. Kildare has “showed with promise dight”">charmed the pulsing night</span>!

Don’t make yourself ridiculous, sir! Leave my hand alone!
You’ll have everybody laughing at you next.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I can’t understand all this! A fortnight ago we met and loved—loved!
Did anybody ever love before? Even this morning you were so sweet and so beautiful
and so happy in our love, and— and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
And <em>you</em>, sir. How did <em>you</em> behave yourself? After we had met
in “Lover’s Walk” and had renewed our vows in sight of the bright blue heavens,
and you had sworn that even if I were a star you’d pluck me down and wear me
in your inmost heart of hearts—after you had vowed that for you there was no other love
in all the wide world, and that if Pa didn’t let us get married right off you’d
p-p-poison yourself with P-P-Paris green—and after you had c-c-carved our initials
in a t-t-true lover’s knot on the b-b-back of the b-b-birchen tree— Oh! what did you do then?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Why, Katie, my own true love—my own darling—! Don’t weep so! What—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Th-th-then you went right off and hunted for shells with that hor-hor-horrid
pink and white S-S-S-Smith girl—that’s what you did, and left your own d-d-darling
to grieve her s-s-sweet young life out all by herself—that’s what you did, and you
know you did, and my heart is broken, and you don’t care a fig for me, and I don’t
care if you don’t, and I’m going to die anyhow, and you know I am, and you don’t care,
and you just wish I would, and you know you do, and— and— I wish I’d never been born,
so I do! Don’t you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Well, bless my soul! Don’t I wish you’d never been born? Why, Katie, there’s something
the matter with you. You’re not well. You can’t be. Why, it must be that this
delirium of bliss, this wild joy of loving me for the past two weeks, has been
too much for you; and you’re going to have the brain-fever, or something—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
You— you— you’ll never have the brain-fever.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I hope not; but why won’t I, Katie?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Because you don’t love me enough, in the first place; you haven’t had the
d-d-delirium of bliss half so bad as I have, nor the wild joy, nor anything—and
b-b-besides, you haven’t g-g-got the b-b-brains!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Luc.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Ahem! I’ll have to reason with her.
<span class="db">[<i>Aloud</i>]</span>
Now, Katie, just let me show you how unjust and unreasonable you are!
Let us look at this thing calmly. Suppose—not that I want to, for when
I begin to suppose that you had never been born, the sun seems to go
out—to stop shining, as it were—the breeze comes no more laden
with sweet perfumes to fan my fevered brow and to cool my wildly
working— ahem!— brains. The calm bright sea becomes as a desert
waste of arid sand, and the sweet flowers are as noxious weeds. Yon
beauteous moon sailing majestically through the heavens becomes a
tallow dip, flickering and sputtering in— in— in something or other;
and the stars—the stars? why, there <em>are</em> no stars! Unable to look upon
and wink at such misery as they see filling my heart, unable to witness
my agony, for very pity and in self-defense they have crept
back into their holes and— and pulled the holes in after them.
But it is too much! I cannot consent to even imagine that you had never been
born! I would do anything in the world to oblige you—anything but
that. Do not ask me. It is too much! I would go wild!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Kate</span> [<i>softly and gently</i>]</span>
Do you really feel that way, Lucius?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Do I? No, no, no! For you have gathered from my words
but a faint idea of the overwhelming agony that fills my bosom at the
thought— distracting thought! Multiply your conception of what I
feel by a million times a million, and then you will but dimly comprehend
the very beginning of the shadow of that which I would feel,
even countless ages hence, at such a thought.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Then I guess m-m-maybe you’d better not try to think it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
No, I guess I’d b-b-better not!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
B-b-but Lucius, my soul’s emperor, don’t you love
that huh-huh-hideous Smith girl a <em>bit?</em> Even a l-l-little bit?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Love the Smith girl—that pink-and-white party with the carroty hair
and the pug nose? My bosom’s empress, listen! Will you believe your Lucius?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, Lucius, I <em>want</em> to believe you <em>so</em> much.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Think of loving Miss Smith—! May I be—

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Kate</span> [<i>opening her arms</i>]</span>
Enough! enough! My Lucius! You have convinced me. Your burning words have
brought back to me the wild delirium of bliss just as bad as it ever was.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Ah, I thought so. To doubt your own—! But, darling, you oughtn’t to say that
you have the wild delirium just as <em>bad</em> as ever, because, you see, it
isn’t <em>bad</em>.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Don’t you see?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes. But what ought I to say, precious?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Say “just as good,” or “just as strongly,” or— or— “just as completely,
overpoweringly, overwhelmingly, immensely much as ever.”

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Say no more, Lucius. I’m cured. I’ll never be jealous again.
I’ll nestle me down contented in your heart, and reck nothing of the
storms that blow outside.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I should say not. And to think that I ever should be fool enough to think,
when gazing on her, that I see Heaven in Miss Smith’s eyes!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
I’m ashamed of myself.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Do you suppose that I could ever delude myself into imagining that her
carroty hair was sunlit gold?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, Lucius! It makes me feel so nice.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Or that I saw the rosy tint of the dawn upon <em>her</em> cheek,
or that <em>she</em> would ever remind me of a garden of roses?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Then promise me one thing, Lucius!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Only <em>one</em> thing?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, but it will comprise everything, and is all I ask. Promise me that
you will be very polite but very cold and distant with Miss Smith.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Miss Smith will think when she meets me that she has got into
a whole school of gorgeously beautiful but frigidly frozen ice-bergs.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
And you won’t dance with her?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Never! I’ll not encourage her in any way. I swear it before high Heaven!

<center><h2>Act III</h2></center>

<p><span class="sc">Scene.—</span><i>A dive in New York, inhabited by <span class="sc">Brown</span>
and his confederates. Not filthy, but a low place, evidently a place of refuge from the police—well
guarded, capable of resistance and defense, and having means of escape. <span class="sc">Brown</span>,
<span class="sc">Bill</span>, and his <span class="sc">Chorus of Thieves</span> are discovered
smoking pipes and drinking.
<span class="sc">Wyvern</span> lying on a cot, still asleep. One of the company on guard
watching <span class="sc">Wyvern</span> and the door.</i>

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
The old fellow sleeps well. He ought to rouse soon. You are sure you didn’t drug him too heavily, Bill?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
No, I think not. I gave him only enough, as I supposed, to keep him in the stupid condition that the
drink left him in, till we got him here. He’ll wake soon; let’s sing a song.
All’s quiet, and the cops haven’t tumbled to our racket. Fill up, boys, and let us have
the “Jolly Jack Tar.”

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Bill</span>
<p> Three lovely daughters had jolly Jack Tar,
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light.
 And dreaming of them as he sailed afar,
 Away from them and their dutiful <i>mar</i>,
 He swore to himself by yon glimmering star
 They never should wed a jolly jack tar—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light!
<p> The eldest of all was his heart’s delight,
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light.
 He made up his mind one stormy dark night
 That a Senator grand, with manners polite,
 Should capture the hand of this beautiful sprite—
 But she married a snip of a midshipmite—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light!
<p> The next was a lassie with nut-brown hair,
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light.
 Mother adored her; she’d never a care;
 And fondly he thought the Parson of Ayer
 And number two, sweet, would make a fine pair—
 She skipped one night with an oyster dredg<i>aire</i>—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light!
<p> He swore once again, by the Great Horn Spoon—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light—
 The last girl should wed a dashing dragoon
 Who jingled big spurs and hummed out of tune—
 She gave him away with manners quite soon
 And followed a lad who could splice the jib-boom—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light!
<p> Then jolly Jack Tar to the doldrums went,
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light.
 He said to his wife he’d put up a cent
 To back his belief that Heaven’s intent,
 In sending all girls, while doubtless well meant,
 Was wide of its purpose by willfulness bent—
 &emsp; As he trimmed the binnacle light!
</div>

<p>[<i>During the song <span class="sc">Wyvern</span> begins to toss about uneasily. Finally,
while they sing the last verse and chorus, he sits bolt upright, gazing at them and his surroundings

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Brown</span> [<i>addressing <span class="sc">Wyvern</span></i>]</span>
Well, precious one, darlin’ tootsey-wootsey, has it had a nice nap? Would it like to see its
darling Clothilde?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Where am I, sir? What does this mean?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Bill</span> [<i>assuming a confidential tone and air</i>]</span>
You see, the fact is, governor, you got a little full last night and had to be assisted, as you may say.
Not to put too fine a point on it, you were so disgracefully tight that we couldn’t think of
leaving you.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>impatiently and imperiously</i>]</span>
How came I here, sir? What does this mean?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Bill</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]</span>
That’s just what I was a-comin’ to, sir, when you interrupted me. Try to be calm and I’ll make
it all plain to you. As I was a-sayin’, you were in such a lamentably disgraceful condition of
intoxication as would have broke your own Clothilde’s heart to see you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
How dare you speak so familiarly of—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Go easy, go easy! Don’t get excited; you might say something that you didn’t mean to say, you know.
Least said, soonest mended. As I was sayin’, we brought you here to keep you till you got all
sobered up comfortable and nice.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
<em>Will</em> you tell me—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
In course I will. Seein’s we didn’t want you to disgrace yourself, bein’ friends of your’n—

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Friends of mine—! I never saw you before in my life!

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Oh, come now; yes, you have. Think a little. Can’t you remember me, for instance? or my friend
the Reverend Mr. Brown, as sets over there a-smokin’ and a-smilin’ and a-overlookin’ your disgraceful
conduct just as friendly-like as—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
The fact, is, governor, I reckon you don’t remember much about last night’s performances, do you?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>very much bewildered</i>]</span>
I remember nothing but the ball; and after supper I— I don’t, somehow—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
No, I thought you didn’t. Fact is, you were in a very bad shape; so we played the good Samaritan
on you, you see—for fear harm might come to you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Precisely. Just as the Reverend Mr. Brown says. Why, think of it. If it hadn’t been for us
old friends a-lookin’ after you, you might have fallen into the hands of wicked, bad, designing
men, who might have robbed you, you see.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Enough! If you have cared for me so kindly, I will be glad to remunerate you and take my leave.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Now, that’s what I call handsome. Didn’t I tell you, brother Brown, says I, “Here’s a man that
will appreciate our thoughtful care and act accordin’.”

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
All right; but where do you propose to go to?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
After my conduct of last night, which you very properly characterize as disgraceful, I think
I’d better get right back to New York, and—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
—And you’ll be delighted to know that that’s just where you are now!

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
What, in New York? How—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Precisely so! A gentleman always knows how to feel for another gentleman, and so—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
We saw how your feelings would worry you, and so we just brought you over on the two A.M. express;
and here you are—

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
“Right side up, with care,” sound ’s a dollar, and all comfortable.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span>
[<i>rising to go, and handing <span class="sc">Brown</span> a bank-note</i>]</span>
Very well, my good fellow. This, I trust, will reimburse and remunerate you;
and with many thanks for your kindness, I will go.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Brown</span>
[<i>looking at the money</i>]</span>
Ye-e-es. Don’t you think, governor, that you are squandering too much money on the
cause? Ten dollars is a good deal in these times to a poor man, and maybe you can’t
really afford to be so lavish.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Oh, never mind that, sir! That’s all right. I don’t think it’s too much, for you really
seem to be a worthy set of fellows.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Poor, but respectable an’ honest an’ deservin’. You’ve hit it about right, governor;
but, as the Reverend Mr. Brown says, ten dollars seems to be quite princely.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Don’t say any more; and—ah!—good day, gentlemen.

<p>[<i><span class="sc">Wyvern</span> goes to the door, where he is confronted
by <span class="sc">Bill</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
But really, governor, we couldn’t think o’ lettin’ you go and deprive us of your
society in that way.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>nervously</i>]</span>
What do you mean?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
And don’t you think yourself it’s rather hard on us, to go and tear yourself away from kind friends
and comrades, as one might say?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But really, my friend, I must go.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
And not even leave us a lock of your hair to remember you by?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
It strikes me that this is nonsense. I have had enough of it. Be kind enough to let me go.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Couldn’t think of it just yet, governor. We’re too fond of you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
We might as well get down to business, sir, and have done with this child’s play.
We want money; and the sooner it is forthcoming, the sooner you can go to your home.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Am I to understand that you will not release me unless I pay you money?

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
You struck it that time, governor. A fellow can easy see that you’ve been a business man all your life!
Just think how he gets right at the marrow of the thing, quick as a flash.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
How dare you attempt such a thing as this? I’ll not stand it. I’ll alarm the neighborhood—call the police—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
I wouldn’t do that, if <em>I</em> were in your place. You see that there are several of us here;
and we want money, want it bad, and intend to have it.
When we undertook this little speculation, we counted the cost.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>badly frightened</i>]</span>
But I have no money with me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Never mind about that. Your order is good for the money.
You sit down here and write a letter that I will dictate.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
To whom?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
To your daughter Katie, to be sure.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But she’s not in town. She is at the sea-shore.

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
No, she isn’t. Why, do you know what time it is, governor?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
What time is it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Just twenty minutes to four.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
In the afternoon?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
In the afternoon. There was a high old time at the beach this
morning when your absence was discovered. Miss Katie went into
hysterics; your sweet Clothilde had quite a succession of fainting fits;
and Miss Lottie went distracted. The only sensible person about was
that young jackanapes Jones. They all came to town before noon.
The police have been notified and are searching high and low for you;
but you needn’t hope! They’ll never find you here. There is only
one way for you to get out of this, and that is by paying over the sugar.
Now, you sit right down here and write what I tell you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Four o’clock! And I’ve been here—

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Since three o’clock this morning.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
I begin to see it. Out in the moonlight some one gave me something
to drink. I was drugged!

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Never mind about what was the matter with you. Write the
letter as I tell you, if you want to get out of this place alive.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Oh! Of course I’ll write it.
<span class="db">[<i>Takes paper, etc.</i>]</span>
What shall I say?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Head it 13397 Broadway, August 15th.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But there is no such number!

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
Never you mind. Put it down.
<span class="db">[<i><span class="sc">Wyvern</span> writes</i>]</span>
Now, go on:
<p>“My dear Katie: I was suddenly called away from the beach last
night to consummate a purchase of real estate which I have long been
negotiating. I hope you suffered no serious annoyance at my hasty
departure, and am sorry to learn that you have come back to the city,
as I contemplated returning to the beach this evening. But since you
are at home, you can save me a little trouble. The bearer is a trusty
friend. I need money to close the bargain I have mentioned. Go to
the library, and in my desk—you will find the key in the tray of my
trunk—you will observe a small drawer to the left of the pigeon-holes:
a drawer with a small ebony knob.”
<span class="db">[<i>At this <span class="sc">Wyvern</span> drops
the pen and gazes at <span class="sc">Brown</span></i>]</span>
Well, what’s the matter with you? Go on!
<p>“Take the drawer out entirely.
Place your hand in the vacancy, and in the lower right-hand
corner you will find a spring.”

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
In Heaven’s name, who are you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
No matter. Go on!

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
How did you know—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
I know more than you would imagine, perhaps. Go on!
<p>“Touch the spring and a panel will open. You will find there some bank bills.
Seal them up in a large envelope, and address the envelope to me, and
give it to the bearer. I will be home by nine o’clock at the latest.
Invite such of our neighbors as may be in the city—be sure Madame Le Brun
is there—and we will have an impromptu little party to celebrate
the successful accomplishment of this speculation, which I have long
had my heart on.
<p>“With a kiss and a blessing for my good little daughter, I am, your loving Papa,
<span class="sc">Frederick G. Wyvern.</span>”
<p>That’s all right. Now, would you like to know how I knew about
your desk and the secret drawer?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Indeed I would. I can’t imagine—I supposed no one knew anything
about it but me. How did you know it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
To tell the truth, I didn’t know it. I only guessed at it—but I
struck it. When I told you that it was nearly four o’clock in the
afternoon I merely lied to you. It isn’t two o’clock yet. I could have
taken your check; but it wouldn’t be safe, with the police on the watch,
to present it at the bank. When I dictated the sentence about the
desk I did it at a venture. When I saw you start, I knew I had you.
If you had not started, I would have had you instruct Miss Katie to
send your check-book from the desk, and would have had to take the
risk of the police at the bank. Do you see? Now I will do myself
the honor to call on Miss Katie at 1927 Gramercy Park. Address this
envelope—

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
I’ll not do it! I’ll not be robbed in this shameless way! I’ll
die first!
<span class="db">[<i>Springs up from the table</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Brown</span>
If you attempt to make any noise, I’ll kill you. Sit down and
address the envelope!
<span class="db">[<i><span class="sc">Wyvern</span> nervously complies</i>]</span>
And now, good-bye for a while. You will be home at nine o’clock,
and will find your friends ready to welcome you. Good-bye!

<p>[<i>Exit <span class="sc">Brown</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
What a head for business my reverend friend has got, now, hasn’t he?

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
Very well. I’m at your mercy and must do whatever you say.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Now, that is business! And then you can hie thee to thine
own sweet Clothilde! Think of that! Think of the rapture of that
meeting! Think of enfolding her onc’t more in one long embrace!
Oh, ecstasy! While we’re waiting, couldn’t you give us a song,
governor, something good and sentimental?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Wyv.</span> [<i>faintly</i>]</span>
No; I can’t sing. Oh! this dreadful place! Please do not ask it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Bill</span>
Couldn’t think of it, governor. Must have a song. And we
must have a good sentimental one, too. None o’ your comic songs,
for we are regular out-and-out sentimental fellows.

<p><span class="sc dr">Wyv.</span>
But I tell you I can’t sing now—and I won’t, that’s all!

Oh, yes, you will!

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Well, what news?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Not much of anything. Haven’t found Wyvern yet, although
the police think he is concealed here somewhere by that gang.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
What could be their object?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Money. A little while ago a fellow came to 1927 with a letter
from the old man to Miss Katie, asking her to send him some money
from the desk in the library, saying that he wanted it for some real
estate purchase he was about to make. She brought it to me and I
saw at once it was a fraud. She was going to get the money but I
stopped her and told her to wait till I could speak with the man who
brought the note; but when I got to the door he had disappeared.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Well, this is most extraordinary.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Yes; but it does no good to stand here talking about it. We
had better go back to the house and see if there is any more news.
The police promised to report there every half hour. Miss Katie is
frantic.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
We can at least cheer them up a little. To think that such a
thing should happen right here in New York!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
The old fool ought to have a guardian. What with his vanity
and his love of wine, he is too weak to be allowed at large.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Do you know, I have an idea that that bleached blonde of a
widow has something to do with this.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I haven’t a doubt of it. I begged Miss Katie not to bring her
along; but she thinks maybe she has done her a wrong, and in her
remorse—now that the old man’s missing—she has brought her in and
installed her right in the house. Another thing: if that French
Canadian, with the dancing bear, you know, up in the mountains, wasn’t
the high cockalorum of that Chinese gang, then I’m mistaken.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Why do you think so?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
The same voice, build, and size. You know, I saw the fellow
when they carried the old man off.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
It may be. But let us go to 1927; we may be needed.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
If something is not developed soon, Miss Katie will go crazy.

It certainly is a wonderful story. In all my long experience on

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I imagine not!
<span class="db">[<i>Aside</i>]</span>
The question is, ought I to allow such

About four feet from him, I should say.

<p><span class="sc dr">Smith</span>
Possibly your wife there

No, Mr. Smith. The first duty of a Christian—ahem!—is to forgive

this evening till I could prove that I was not a member of Mr. Brown’s

My soul’s empress, I never felt my love so strongly as now.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
<em>Mister Jones?</em> What is this?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Kate</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Now I’m going to break his heart. I know he’ll suffer
awfully, but that’s the way. And it must be done. I really pity
him, but I <em>must</em> do it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span> 
Katie, will you be kind enough, perhaps, to tell me what this
sudden change means—why you stand there mumbling inarticulately—why
you just called me “Mister Jones”?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes, I will tell you. I call you Mr. Jones because it wouldn’t
be proper for me to call you anything else now. I must be frank with
you. To be kind, I must be cruel.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Yes? You grow interesting. May I ask you to proceed, Miss Wyvern?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Frankly, it cannot be. The dream is over and past. The unwelcome truth
that I no longer love you forces itself upon me. I assure you,
Mr. Jones, that it is not pleasant to have to say this.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
No? Do you seem to suffer much?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Indeed, nothing but a sense of duty wrings the confession from me.
It gives me great pain.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Then, candidly, I wouldn’t confess it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
A sense of duty impels me! It gives me great pain, because I
know that <em>you</em> will be deeply hurt.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Oh!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Because I know that, this sweet dream of happiness dispelled,
you will probably be driven almost insane and will suffer terribly.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Ah.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Because I feel that, this cup of bliss dashed from your lips, you
may be stricken down by a serious illness and possibly toss upon a
bed of anguish for long, long weary months.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
That isn’t a cheerful outlook.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Or it may be that, to drown your sorrow, you will fly to dissipation
and almost wreck your bright and beautiful manhood by terrible excesses.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
I see—rum. “Rum” being a generic term, you know, under which
is comprehended all intoxicating drinks.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Alas, yes!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Have you any choice as to which particular poison you would rather
have me ruin myself with? Now, there’s beer—I confess I’m rather
partial to beer—

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, no, Lu— that is, Mr. Jones! Beer wouldn’t do at all.
There’s nothing romantic in beer!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
No, you’re right in that. Beer wouldn’t do. And champagne—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
That’s it! The wine-cup! The enticing, fascinating, irresistible
wine-cup! That’s romantic.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
And expressive, too. It seems to me that since you insist that
I should sink into dissipated despair, you ought, in all fairness,
to allow me to nominate my own poison. Now, beer is comparatively
inexpensive, and therefore much better adapted to the purpose in the
present case. Now, couldn’t you drop a little, and let me go to ruin
on beer?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
No, I could never consent to that! And oh, when I picture to
myself a meeting with you some time when I am strolling home from
the opera, leaning on the arm of— of— say, Count Rudolph; and
you pass me by, your handsome face bearing the terrible marks of
dissipation—your attire still rich and gentlemanly, but disordered and
in elegant, expressive <i>negligé</i>—your step unsteady and your
hand tremulous—and when, in passing, I see the look of haunting despair
in your lily-white eyes—no, I mean your bloodshot eyes—then I know
that I will say to myself: “Unhappy I, to cause such ruin”; and I will
be sad all the rest of the way home. Oh, it will be splendidly sad!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
So it will—and what will I say to myself?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, poor thing, you will say to yourself: “<em>There</em> is the only
human being I ever did or ever can love! For her I gave up all the
brilliant promise of my life. For her I yielded up and sacrificed my
manhood. For her, and on account of her, I became the miserable
wreck that I am. But I love her still! Oh, ye gods, how I love her
still! And the memory of this fleeting glimpse of her will live and
burn in my heart for ages!”

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
That’s what I’ll say?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Well, that isn’t so bad. And what will the Count Rudolph say?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, he won’t say anything, because he won’t know anything about it, you know.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Oh, he won’t know anything about it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
No. At most, he may feel the tremor of my hand on his arm as
I nervously clutch it as you pass, and will look down into my face
with his aristocratic dark eyes and say: “Is the night air chill,
my Katie?” That will be all. And I will retunr a careless answer,
although my heart will be beating like a frightened bird’s!
Indeed, it will be dreadfully sad!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Very sad indeed, I should think. And do you know what
Count Rudolph will say to himself the next day while he shaves me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
While he shaves you?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Yes. When I go into the shop the next day—the shop where he is
employed—as he lathers my face, he will suddenly recognize me
and give a start, and will say, “Mein Gott in Himmel! Wass is doss?
Dot is dot veller wat make leetle Katerina yump ven I wass tookin’
a walluk by her yesterday! Could it been dot he wass an olt
schweedheart by her?” And when he begins to shave me, when he
gets his razor down about my jugular, the awful demon of jealousy
will seize him and he will say, “Yust so goot dot I slice dot
drunken hett off”; and while he is gathering courage to do so,
I will look him calmly in the eye, and by sheer superiority of optic
bulldozing will break him down with fear till he fairly trembles;
and then I will say aloud, “See here, Dutchy—if you cut me, I’ll break
every bone in your body!” Oh, it will be splendidly sad!

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Why, what do you mean?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
What do <em>you</em> mean? Three days ago you loved me so much
that you couldn’t bear me out of your sight. Now you say you don’t
love me. Will you explain?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Why, don’t you see that it must be so? What kind of love
would that be that didn’t have despair and all that in it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Oh. I see.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes! And then you see, Mr. Jones, so long as Pa wouldn’t let
me love you, I did love you to distraction. Then, when he said I might
love you, and became even anxious that I should—why, somehow I
didn’t seem to love you so much; and finally I grew indifferent;
and, at last, the chains of your affection became galling, and— and—
in short, it is all over between us. We must part.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
And do you feel no remorse that you have thus trifled with my
sweet young affections?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Oh, I do, I do! I know that, in my dreams, I will be haunted
by visions of your pale, sad, reproachful face. I know it will be just
dreadful, but I can’t help it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Because you don’t love me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Y-y-yes!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Isn’t it too bad! And you don’t seem to have that wild delirium
of bliss quite so bad as you did.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
N-n-no!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Poor thing. Shall I leave you now to revel in your remorse?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Please do! And, oh, Mr. Jones, believe me that while our
sweet dream can never be realized, I will always think of you
as a very, very dear friend.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Thank you. I’m sure you’re very kind.

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Yes! As a b-b-brother!

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Don’t you think that would be unwise? Wouldn’t that be almost,
so to speak, too much bliss for me?

<p><span class="sc dr">Kate</span>
Leave me, pray, leave me, Reginald— I mean, Mr. Jones! May Heaven bless you
and soften this dreadful blow to your lacerated, broken heart.

<p><span class="sc dr">Luc.</span>
Sort o’ temper the wind to this shorn lamb? Thank you, Imogene— I mean,
Miss Wyvern— for this kind thoughtfulness; I thank you.

 &emsp; &emsp; We come! we come!
 &emsp; At pleasure’s shrine still bending
 &emsp; &emsp; The hours! the hours!

 Never let a vague hallucination hover

<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Frankly confessing
 &emsp; &emsp; All their transgressing,
 &emsp; &emsp; Wisely professing;
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Would you have more?
 &emsp; &emsp; Wounds thus revealing,
 &emsp; &emsp; Pride, see, is kneeling;
 &emsp; &emsp; Sure with real feeling
 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; We may implore
 &emsp; &emsp; Your tender, kindly charity
 &emsp; &emsp; For culprits three whom there you see,
 &emsp; &emsp; Late smitten by wild lunacy,
 &emsp; &emsp; All singing the same tune, you see!
<p> From mountain and shore come we, etc.
