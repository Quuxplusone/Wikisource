<p>John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Free Lance</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The dialogue and stage directions are based on those in
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/2023864815/">a typescript</a>
from the Library of Congress’ Sousa collection.
Lyrics are largely as they appear in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/imslp-free-lance-sousa-john-philip/page/n3">the piano/vocal score</a>
issued 1906 by the John Church Company, with some interpolations from the typescript.
Some fairly large corrections, adjustments, and compromises have been quietly applied. Some
even larger questions, and substitutions made on my own authority, are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.
<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

<p><span class="sc">Scene.—</span><i>Garden of the Emperor’s Palace.
At back is a marble terrace with colonnade and wide steps. At right and
left of the steps, on pedestals, are marble statues, not quite finished.
Beyond, a view of a park and garden. At right and left are fine old trees
whose branches meet in an arch at center, forming a canopy of foliage.
Flower beds and climbing roses wherever practical.</i>

<p>[<i>Discovered: <span class="sc">Lords</span> and <span class="sc">Ladies</span>
of the Court; <span class="sc">Pages</span> and <span class="sc">Maids of Honor</span>.
The costumes are of white or light tints and gold. All are occupied as amateurs
of literature and art. Several are working at pictures on easels. Several have
scrolls and quill pens and are composing poetry. Others are playing upon musical
instruments of antique pattern, some of these instruments being quite clumsy and
grotesque. Some are writing music; others are working upon the unfinished statues
on the pedestals. A group of pages are gathered about one of their number who is
reading from an illustrated book.</i>

<p>[<i>The scene represents a court whose members have risen above the sordid
details of everyday life and have become devotees of art.</i>]

<p> On parchment fair, with grey-goose quill,
 &emsp; With easel, brushes, and palette;
 &emsp; &emsp; With lyre and lute
 &emsp; &emsp; Or cithern or flute
 &emsp; Or else with chisel and mallet,
 We work all day with zeal and will
 &emsp; All happy and optimistic;
 &emsp; &emsp; It’s the proper thing
 &emsp; &emsp; At the court of a King
 &emsp; Who is nothing if not artistic.
<p><span class="left sc">Four Girls</span> &emsp; &emsp; We love to paint

 &emsp; &emsp; To art inclined,
 &emsp; Expressing ev’ry emotion,

 &emsp; And worship in all devotion.
<p><span class="left sc">Four Tenors</span> &emsp; &emsp; We are the poets lyrical,
 &emsp; &emsp; The tragic and satirical,
 &emsp; Devoting all our time

 &emsp; The pure and perfect rhyme.
<p><span class="left sc">Musicians</span><p> &emsp; &emsp; Musicians we

 &emsp; To lead a life harmonious.
 &emsp; &emsp; We sing and play

 &emsp; Evoking sounds euphonious.
 With heart and voice
 Our music bids the poor old world rejoice.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> All lovely art—
 &emsp; We worship at thy shrine.
 With lovely heart
 &emsp; We beg the grace divine.
 We give no heed
 &emsp; To sordid things of Earth.
 To us indeed
 &emsp; They are of little worth.
 Our creditors may rail;
 &emsp; From them we gladly part
 To worship thee! All hail,
 &emsp; O wise and lovely art!
 &emsp; &emsp; All hail!

<p><span class="sc dr">Jacq.</span>
Ah, what an ideal court is ours. Think of it—a whole nation of poets, painters, sculptors,
musicians.

<p><span class="sc dr">Leand.</span>
In the entire empire of Braggadocia there is no one who can be charged with being of
the least possible use.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">All</span> [<i>languishing</i>]</span>
Lovely, indeed!

<p><span class="sc dr">Diane</span>
At present we should have but two themes for our inspiration: Love and marriage.

<p><span class="sc dr">Leand.</span>
Love and marriage! Art is not broad enough to include both!

<p><span class="sc dr">Jacq.</span>
The marriage of our Princess Yolande is expected daily.

<p><span class="sc dr">Diane</span>
And, that over, perhaps her maids of honor may have a chance.

<p>[<i>That flourish of trumpets which is identified with the
<span class="sc">Princess Yolande</span> is heard offstage.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Leand.</span>
The Princess! our Princess Yolande!

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Yol.</span> [<i>imperiously</i>]</span>
Be silent, all of you. How have you the minds for gaiety when you know what my fate
is to be? <span class="db">[<i>Comes down</i>]</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Leand.</span>
Is it so dreadful a thing, then, Princess, to be married to a prince?

<p><span class="sc dr">Yol.</span>
How can I tell how dreadful it may be when I have never seen him?
<span class="db">[<i>Impetuously</i>]</span>
Marry a man I have never seen! Is he tall or short? Fair or ugly?
Generous or miserly? Does he squint? Hath he a humpback—a limp—bowed legs—a hare-lip?
Who knows? Not I! And I must marry this Prince Florian?
<span class="db">[<i>In a burst of rage</i>]</span> Marry him! ah!—

<p><span class="sc dr">Diane</span>
But perhaps you may love him.

<p><span class="sc dr">Yol.</span>
Love! <span class="db">[<i>Laughs</i>]</span>
Prate not to me of love. Who knows what it is? Can you weigh it, measure it, see it?
I vow I never yet met two persons who held the same opinion of this love.

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Yolande</span></p>
<p><span class="left sc">Yol.</span> Within a convent garden old
 &emsp; I met a calm and saintly nun;
 The story of her heart all told,
 &emsp; Her worldly day forever done.
 No more for her the smiles and sighs,
 &emsp; That once a lover’s heart might stir.
 She looked on me with thoughtful eyes,
 &emsp; And—“What is love?” I asked of her.
<p> Her pale lips trembled with a sigh
 &emsp; And this to me she made reply:
<p> “Daughter, shun this earthly love.
 “Fix your thoughts, I pray, above.
 “Love is a boat on a troubled stream—
 “Love is the grief at the end of a dream—
 “Love is a blossom that fades away—
 “Woe for a life, pays joy for a day.
 “List to me, daughter; alas, I know,
 “For I loved once in the long ago.”
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Daughter, shun this earthly love, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Yol.</span> I met a maiden fair to see,
 &emsp; The vision of a summer day;
 As pretty as a girl can be,
 &emsp; And oh, she had a winning way.
 She had alluring eyes of blue,
 &emsp; The laughing lips that men prefer;
 The ways of man methought she knew,
 &emsp; So—“What is love?” I asked of her.
<p> She laughed until I blushed for shame,
 And thus replied this <span class="unclear" title="Thus in typescript; p/v has “lively”">lovely</span> dame:
<p> “Why, love’s the sport of a summer day;
 &emsp; “It must be gay and jolly.
 “And love’s the debt that men must pay
 &emsp; ”For leading us to folly.
 ”To make them think you an angel are
 &emsp; ”From heaven up above,
 ”Then laugh in scorn when you make them mourn—
 &emsp; ”That’s my idea of love.”
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Yes, love’s the sport of a summer day, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Yol.</span> I chanced to meet a soldier bold,
 &emsp; So flashing in his brave array,
 With an easy air to all the fair—
 &emsp; No damsel ever said him nay.
 He doffed his hat and smiled at me
 &emsp; Until I blushed a rosy red.
 “You must be mine; you’re quite divine,”
 &emsp; And—“What know you of love?” I said.
<p> He put his arm ’round me like this,
 And said, ”Well—love? I’ll teach you, miss.”
<p> “To march a-swaggering into town
 &emsp; “While the girls admire our glory,
 “To win the hearts of the village maids
 &emsp; “And tell the same old story.
 “To win the prettiest of the belles you meet
 &emsp; “Wherever you rove o’er land or sea,
 “Then march away, though they grieve for aye,
 &emsp; “Why, that’s the love for me.”
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> To march a-swaggering into town, etc.

<p><span class="sc dr">Yol.</span>
But I shall know soon what manner of man I am to marry.
Sir Pertinax returns today from the Court of Graftiana.

<p><span class="sc dr">Syl.</span>
Yes, we shall know the worst at once; for here is Sir Pertinax.

<p><span class="sc dr">Yol.</span>

Nor I—nor I!

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
I regret very much to say that I utterly disagree with you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Yol.</span>
Why, nobody has said anything!

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
Ah, but you are <em>thinking</em> things, and, as Court Censor, disapproval is
the breath of life to me. Princess, it is all arranged. You are to marry Florian to-day.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Yol.</span> [<i>enraged</i>]</span>
There! You see? I am disposed of as a chattel. I am goods in the market-place,
no more. I am produce—wares—a commodity.
<span class="db">[<i>The <span class="sc">Maids of Honor</span> try to soothe her</i>]</span>
And what manner of man is the Prince, my purchaser?

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
Madam, he has done but one clever thing in his life, and that was to select his
father.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Yol.</span> [<i>enraged again</i>]</span>
There! You hear? He is a clod! I shall never marry him—never! Tell that to my father.
Let him take care, when he makes the sale, that he can deliver the merchandise.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
What a heavenly life awaits the happy bridegroom.

<p><span class="sc dr">Jacq.</span>
Does it not delight you, O Pertinax, to bask again in an artistic atmosphere?

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
I detest it. I do not approve of our Emperor’s ambition. He wishes everything—to
be everybody—artist, musician, poet, diplomat, warlord. He would fain shake the
thrones with one hand while he writes a comic opera with the other. In fact, he—

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Herald</span>, interrupting.</i>]

<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Emperor</span></p>
<p><span class="left sc">Emp.</span> I grant that there are people who have talents rather various,
 &emsp; Quite capable and clever
 &emsp; In some fields of endeavor;
 But I opine my genius is much more multifarious;
 &emsp; My general proficience
 &emsp; Is the next thing to omniscience.
 Of course there may be others with a little stray ability,
 But I’m the sole monopolist of wholesale versatility.
 There’s not an art or science of which anyone may tell
 &emsp; In which I do not perfectly excel.
<p> But I do it all by proxy,
 &emsp; By proxy, by proxy;
 Oh, I hire a clever chap to represent me, don’t you see.
 I think it’s rather foxy—
 &emsp; It certainly is foxy—
 Oh, another fellow does the work; the credit comes to me!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> He does it all by proxy,
 &emsp; By proxy, by proxy;
 Oh, he hires a clever chap to represent him, don’t you see.
 He thinks it’s rather foxy—
 &emsp; It certainly is foxy—
 Oh, another fellow does the work, and he’s the legatee!
<p><span class="left sc">Emp.</span> As a poet I have made myself a veritable laureate;
 &emsp; My verses are so pretty,
 &emsp; So pathetic or so witty.
 I read while at my breakfast, and though critics may excoriate,
 &emsp; High praise of them I mutter
 &emsp; As I munch my bread and butter.
 There may be other poets, but their verse is weak and tenuous;
 My verses, on the contrary, are vigorous and strenuous;
 I hire a pauper bard to write my grand immortal rhyme—
 &emsp; It really saves me quite a lot of time.
<p> But I do it all by proxy,
 &emsp; By proxy, by proxy;
 Oh, he works for board and lodging and is grateful as can be.
 I think it’s rather foxy—
 &emsp; It certainly is foxy—
 Oh, I get him very cheap and all the credit comes to me!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> He does it all by proxy, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Emp.</span> As military hero I’m remarkably industrious;
 &emsp; Of Mars I am the image
 &emsp; In the carnage of a scrimmage;
 I’ve fought and died on many fields to win a name illustrious;
 &emsp; In fact I’m so courageous
 &emsp; That I have been called rampageous.
 I’ve often laid a forlorn hope and died to win a victory—
 Although my telling you may seem a trifle contradictory—
 My hero’s grave is yonder; it’s a monument ornate;
 &emsp; I’m lying—yes, I’m lying there in state.
<p> But I do it all by proxy,
 &emsp; By proxy, by proxy;
 Oh, I hired a bright young fellow who was me a while, you see—
 I fight and die by proxy—
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; It’s hardly orthodoxy—
<span class="left sc">Emp.</span> He’s found a hero’s finish and the credit comes to me!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> He does it all by proxy, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Emp.</span> And when it comes to music I am right in line with Orpheus,
 &emsp; A real virtuoso;
 &emsp; I do not think, I <em>know</em> so.
 The jealous flee before me while the dull I lull to Morpheus.
 &emsp; With sackbut and with spinet
 &emsp; I am busy ev’ry minute.
 My skill upon the jew’s-harp always quiets vulgar witticism;
 My blasts upon the double-bass compel the kindly criticism;
 And when I play the trumpet it’s the sweetest of all boons;
 &emsp; I’m blowing—yes, I’m blowing pretty tunes.
<p> But I do it all by proxy,
 &emsp; By proxy, by proxy;
 The bugler I employed would practice night and day, you see.
 I practiced thus by proxy
 &emsp; Till nervous folks drank Moxie.
 The neighbors rose and slew him, but the credit comes to me!
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> He does it all by proxy
 And is clever as can be.

<p><span class="sc dr">Emp.</span>

Magnificent, Your Majesty. My eyes were dazzled by the finest jewels.
The rarest dishes regaled me. Several orchestras were constantly on
the <i>qui vive</i>—

<p><span class="sc dr">Emp.</span>
The what?

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
The <i>qui vive</i>.—In the park a fountain poured wine like water.
Everywhere the eye rested were evidences of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.

<p><span class="sc dr">Emp.</span>
In–deed! Well, we must do the same.

<p><span class="sc dr">Pert.</span>
But, Your Majesty, our treasury is empty.

<p><span class="sc dr">Emp.</span>
All the more reason for keeping up appearances. Let their eyes be dazzled by jewels.
Engage several orchestras to play off the key, or whatever you said. And, Pertinax,
don’t forget the fountain. It must spout wine-water. Wherever the eye rests, let it
meet evidences of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. We haven’t got the wealth,
but we may be able to scrape up the evidences.

Not unless my hair grows again. I’ve tried everything.

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Siegmund</span></p>
<p> What makes a man a poet or musician?
 &emsp; What makes a man succeed at any game?
 What makes a man win out in his ambition?
 &emsp; I have a theory about the same.
 For instance, there’s the old-time hero Samson;
 &emsp; Such muscles as he had are very rare.
 But a lady-friend attracted by a ransom
 &emsp; Caught him asleep and slyly cut his hair.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; It was his hair
 &emsp; &emsp; That got him there.
 &emsp; You mostly always tell a great man by his hair.
 &emsp; &emsp; Though philosophers have said
 &emsp; &emsp; All depends upon the head,
 &emsp; Not at all—it all depends upon the hair.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> It was his hair, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Sieg.</span> You’ve heard the great piano-playing wonder
 &emsp; Whose noise the av’rage thunder-storm can’t drown;
 All other iv’ry-pounders knuckle under
 &emsp; When Mister What’s-his-name-ski comes to town.
 They talk about his technique so artistic;
 &emsp; His genius, we know, is very rare.
 The ladies think he has a magic mystic;
 &emsp; It isn’t that at all—it is his hair.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; It is his hair,
 &emsp; &emsp; That halo fair,
 &emsp; That makes the girls adore and love him ev’rywhere.
 &emsp; &emsp; Oh, his technique and his touch
 &emsp; &emsp; Are not really such a much;
 &emsp; It’s that wonderful chrysanthemum of hair.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> It is his hair, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Sieg.</span> Then there’s the wild and woolly Western Ranger;
 &emsp; A striking personality is his;
 And he can catch the eye of ev’ry stranger
 &emsp; Who never fails to question who he is.
 Of many strange adventures he’s the hero,
 &emsp; But for all that the public doesn’t care.
 His popularity would drop to zero
 &emsp; If it were not for his wild umbrageous hair.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; It was his hair
 &emsp; &emsp; That got him there.
 &emsp; Most people recognize him anywhere.
 &emsp; &emsp; He can shoot all right, of course;
 &emsp; &emsp; He’s a dandy on a horse;
 &emsp; But the genuine attraction is his hair.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> It was his hair, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Sieg.</span> A sweet young girl once journeyed to the city;
 &emsp; Her color and her type were quite brunette;
 She had no luck, and soon—oh, what a pity—
 &emsp; Her cash was nearly gone and she in debt.
 Her sole remaining dollar she expended
 &emsp; For a chemical that turned her hair to gold,
 And in a week she made a marriage splendid:
 &emsp; A millionaire conveniently old.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; It was her hair
 &emsp; &emsp; So fine and fair,
 &emsp; Though some of it at night hung on a chair;
 &emsp; &emsp; Still, her husband old and rich
 &emsp; &emsp; Can’t distinguish which is switch—
 &emsp; He is happy with his little golden hair.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> It was her hair, etc.
<p><span class="left sc">Sieg.</span> A bus’ness-man came home one night so weary;
 &emsp; His office hours that day had not been few;
 His wife caressed him fondly, saying, “Dearie—
 &emsp; “I’ll run and get your slippers, love, for you.”
 But O, that little wife’s love grew colder
 &emsp; (I really can’t repeat the things she said)
 When she espied upon her husband’s shoulder
 &emsp; A raven hair—her own, you see, was red.
<p> &emsp; &emsp; That was the hair
 &emsp; &emsp; That brought despair.
 &emsp; These bus’ness-men should always take good care;
 &emsp; &emsp; And if they’re wise and sage
 &emsp; &emsp; The type-writers they engage
 &emsp; Will have the same domestic shade of hair.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> That was the hair, etc.

<p><span class="sc dr">Sieg.</span>
Married? I guess not! I am already the silent partner in a domestic sketch. But of course
you don’t know my Griselda.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">All</span> [<i>surprised</i>]</span>
Griselda?

<p><span class="sc dr">Duke</span>
That’s all right. You can give up your Griselda. It’s often done in the highest circles.

<p><span class="sc dr">Sieg.</span>
Yes, but it wouldn’t do for me. I don’t go in swollen society. No, I couldn’t shake
Griselda. She’s only a goose-girl; but she’s not so homely, as geese-girls go.
And she has been very kind to me. She always lets me do just as she pleases.

<p><span class="sc dr">Duke</span>
But <em>I</em> say you are going to marry a princess.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Sieg.</span> [<i>aside</i>]</span>
Marry a princess! That’s the job I’ve been looking for all my life.
<span class="db">[<i>Chuckles to himself, much pleased</i>]</span>
But I must be tickled to death without showing it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Duke</span>
After the ceremony we’ll give you a hundred gold pieces. Then you can run away.

<p><span class="sc dr">Sieg.</span>
If I ever got a hundred gold pieces, you wouldn’t see me for dust.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Duke</span> [<i>fiercely</i>]</span>
If you refuse, we will hang you for robbing our son the Prince.

<p><span class="sc dr">Sieg.</span>
Am I to understand correctly—I must either marry a princess, or be hanged?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">All</span> [<i>sternly</i>]</span>
That’s the idea.

<p><span class="sc dr">Sieg.</span>
It’s hard to choose. Excuse me.
<span class="db">[<i>Tosses a coin</i>]</span>
I lose. Bring on your princess.

<p><span class="sc dr">Knights</span>

<span class="db">[<i>All drink</i>]</span>

But if Griselda hears of this, I reserve the right to be hanged.

<p> Women all are perfect pearls
 &emsp; (Or I have been taught so).
 I have known a lot of girls
 &emsp; (Or at least I’ve thought so).
 Some have studied to be wise;
 Some just live to lure the eyes.
 At emotions of the heart
 &emsp; Some are always mocking.
 Quite immune to Cupid’s dart
 &emsp; Is Mam’selle Blue-stocking.
 Some girls watch the stars at night
 And will tell their names aright;
 Speak of love and they’ll take flight—
 &emsp; They are not for me.
<p> <span class="unclear" title="Thus in the piano/vocal score; but surely it should be “Little bas bleu, go blow your horn”">Oh, Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn;</span>

 Is the sweetheart for me, and I think for you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Emp.</span>
I had thought of getting some syndicate to take the war off my hands.

<p><span class="sc dr">Flor.</span>
I know the very promoter for the purpose: Siegmund Lump, the brigand chief.

lost his hair.

<p><span class="sc dr">All</span>
Lost his hair?

Siegmund’s strength, like Samson’s, lay in his hair. He was a lineal descendant

<p><span class="left sc">Flor.</span> In primitive days of the giant race

 A strong man was he, who set the pace,
 &emsp; With a record that none can efface.

 &emsp; His presence created a panic.
 Even his voice caused a thrill of dread,
 &emsp; For Samson, he was titanic.
<p> Yet that hero fell, as heroes ever fall
 &emsp; Who trust in a vain coquette.
 &emsp; &emsp; For a woman’s smiles

 And that was poor Samson’s finish.

<p> Have you a sweetheart you fancy is true,
 &emsp; Far from you now for a year and a day?
 Never a sky that all summer is blue,
 &emsp; Never a maid that is faithful for aye.
 Has she your heart in a bright golden chain?
 &emsp; Think you she loves you where’er you may be?
 Send her a letter to woo her again,
 &emsp; Then if she’s true to you, lad, you’ll see.
<p> &emsp; Buy, buy, buy—
 &emsp; &emsp; Buy, buy, buy—
 Purchase a carrier dove and see
 If she still is faithful or fancy free.
 &emsp; Buy, buy, buy—
 &emsp; &emsp; Buy, buy, buy—
 Oh, purchase a carrier dove and you’ll see
 If faithful your sweetheart can be.
<p> Fond are those smiles you remember so well,
 &emsp; Sweet are those kisses—you know them of old.
 Tender those eyes where your dream used to dwell,
 &emsp; Red are those lips that their secrets unfold.
 Yours were they promised, but whose are they now?
 &emsp; Come buy a pigeon to send to your dear,
 Soon he’ll return with a letter, I trow,
 &emsp; Telling you you have been gone a year.
<p> When I see my pigeons whirling,
 With their snowy wings unfurling,
 &emsp; I laugh to think that one fine day
 &emsp; A heart takes wing and flies away.
 A maid may promise and sweetly coo;
 Your world may dwell in her eyes of blue;
 &emsp; But after a summer her fleeting love
 &emsp; Is swift in its flight as a dove.
 &emsp; &emsp; Fly— fly— fly— fly!

No, no. The war.

The Emperor! Jiminy Christmas, I got to fight on both sides.
