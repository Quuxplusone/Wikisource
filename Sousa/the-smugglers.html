<p>This is Wilson Vance and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Smugglers</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>So far, this is just a transcription of
<a href="https://imslp.org/wiki/The_Smugglers_(Sousa%2C_John_Philip)">the piano/vocal score</a>
(W. F. Shaw, 1881), scanned from the Library of Congress’s Dodrill collection (ML31.S67, box 7 folder 1).
I lack a (public-domain) source for the book.

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated

<p> The widow’s life’s a lonely one,
 &emsp; Poor weak defenceless creature;
 The saddest lot beneath the sun,
 &emsp; With no redeeming feature.
 The widowed home, like a desert gray,
 &emsp; Is monotonously doleful;
 No one to love the live-long day,
 &emsp; When with love she’s heart and soul–full!
<p> The morning breaks both bleak and cold;
 &emsp; How sad she must deny her
 The lux‘ry of a loving scold
 &emsp; As to who shall make the fire!
 She longs for a man who’ll be in the way
 &emsp; And keep her tongue in practice;
 Who’ll swear at the cook, the milliner pay,
 &emsp; And forget the water taxes.
<p> When the widow thinks of the charms all gone,
 &emsp; Of life and <span class="unclear" title="Not in p/v score, but seems grammatically required and euphonious">the</span> joys which comprise it,
 She has no resource but to sit her down
 &emsp; While her lovely eyes she cries out.
 No more for me this lonely life
 &emsp; Of sorrows, sadness, danger;
 My hand I will bestow upon
 &emsp; Some lucky handsome stranger!

<p> I’ve leaped and I’ve climbed like a blawsted goat;
 I’ve worn out my shoes and I’ve ruined my coat;
 I’ve lost my way, likewise my breath;
 I’ve caught a cold, had a call from death.
 Oh, happy I’d be and think it a treat
 If this speculative journey was complete.
<p> I’ve come here, you know, from the love of the arts—
 For some fine photographs of these wild foreign parts.
 And I fear my zeal has been misplaced
 In view of the many great dangers I’ve faced.
 And when I die they will serve me but ill
 If my fame does not this world, resounding, fill.
<p> It always was so, I’m prepared to admit,
 As a fact that’s conceded, <i>viz.</i>, namely, to wit,
 That such artistic genius as I hold in my breast
 Must endure hard raps—must be put to the test!
 But I cannot help saying, if permitted to speak,
 Though the soul is willing, still the flesh is weak.
<p> I don’t like the people I find about here;
 They talk in a gibberish, damnably queer;
 And I think I can say with perfect good taste
 That the land about here is a sheer howling waste!
 Now what is the use of high hills like these,
 When, if they were flatter, they’d much better please;
 When they might be flat with just as much ease?
 Now what is the use of high hills like these,
