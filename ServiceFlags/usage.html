<b>“The Origin, Design and Proper Display of the Service Flag.”</b>
In the <i>Ocala</i> (Florida) <i>Evening Star</i> of 1918-06-14,
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/sn84027621/1918-06-14/ed-1/?sp=3">page 3</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>In response to many inquiries with reference to the service flag, its origin and established usage,
the following memorandum has been prepared from the best available information—not as an official,
authoritative statement, but to answer such inquiries and for the information and guidance of
those who may desire to follow it:
<p>First. The service flag is not an official flag of the government. It has, however, taken such firm
root in popular sentiment and has been of such beneficial influence that it is officially recognized,
and everyone who is entitled to fly it is encouraged and urged to do so.
<p>The service flag was designed by inspiration in the following manner. Mr. R. L. Ineisser
<i>[sic: Queisser]</i>, of Cleveland, O., formerly captain of the machine gun company,
5th Ohio Infantry, retired because of accident, decided shortly after war was declared
that some sign or symbol should be evolved by which it might be known that his sons were away
in their country’s service, and one which would be to their mother a visible sign of the sacrifice
her sons were making. He then designed the flag. The city council of East Cleveland adopted an
ordinance providing that one be presented to the family of every soldier and sailor entering the
service, and it soon received favorable recognition elsewhere, so that it was suggested to him that
he patent it, which he did, the patent being issued to him Nov. 6, 1917. The basic idea of the service
flag is that there shall be a star to represent each person serving with the colors.
<p>Perhaps the best guide as to what persons shall be entitled to this honor is the legislation
enacted by Congress for the benefit of those in the military service <i>[sic]</i> conversely, those
to whom Congress has not seen fit to extend such recognition ought not to be represented on the
service flag, which is limited to those in the military service.
<p>All persons included in the several military forces are, without regard to their sex, deemed
to be “persons in military service.” A woman should be accorded the honor of representation on the
service flag also when in any active service. When flown from a home, a husband, son, father or
brother may properly be represented on the service flag, even though he did not actually leave
from that household directly to go into the service. In case of any more distant relative, they
should actually be members of the household where the flag is displayed and have left for the
service directly from such household.
<p>There is some sentiment in favor of distinguishing flags representing members of a family
from those representing members of an organization, by limiting the individual stars to the family
flags, the organizations to use a single star with a numeral to indicate the number who have gone.
And to represent by silver and gold stars only those who are invalided, wounded or killed. This
would enable anyone clearly to determine in any doubtful case whether the person <i>[sic]</i>
represented were members of the family or employees, and in any case where there are a large number,
would show more distinctly how many have gone from such organizations.
<p>A blue star is used to represent each person, man or woman, in the military or naval service
of the United States. For those killed in action a gold star will be substituted for the blue star.
The idea of the gold star is that <i>[sic]</i> the honor and glory accorded the person for his supreme
sacrifice in offering up for his country his “last full measure of devotion,” and the pride of the
family in it, rather than the sense of personal loss, which would be represented by a mourning symbol,
even though white were to be used instead of black. For those wounded in action a silver star will be
substituted for the blue star or superimposed on it in such manner as to entirely cover it. Use of
the star in this manner would be limited to those entitled to the official wound chevron, which is
awarded to those receiving wounds in action with the enemy or disabled by a gas attack, necessitating
treatment by a medical officer. For those who die from such wounds the gold star will be put on the
silver star with a margin of silver around the gold. For those disabled in line of duty a silver star
will be placed on the blue star, with a margin of blue around the silver. For those who die as a
result of action in line of duty, a gold star with a margin of blue will be substituted. Where men
are reported missing, the presumption is that they have been taken prisoner, unless circumstances
indicate the contrary, and unless authentic information is received that they have been wounded or
killed they should continue to be represented by the blue service star. The roll of honor should be
limited to those entitled to representation on the service flag. It should be headed by those who
have made the supreme sacrifice under the designation “In Memoriam.”

<p class="head"><b>Its Origin—Its Meaning and Those
Entitled to Fly It—The Star of Honor.</b>

<p>No matter from what country a man or woman may have come, his or her
treasured possession should be the red service flag with the blue star
indicating that under the Star Spangled Banner some loved one is fighting to
preserve his and her freedom, our freedom, the freedom of the world.
What does the flag mean? Who originated it? Who is entitled to fly it?
What does the star mean? The silver star? The gold star?
<p>Many people cannot answer these questions, although the service flag is
proudly displayed in thousands of windows throughout the United States.
<p>First of all, any man born abroad who has a son in the United States
Army or Navy, is entitled to this flag as much as a man born in the United
States. To fly it is a great honor. Money cannot buy this privilege. The
flag is for rich and poor alike.

<p><center><b>What the Blue Means.</b></center>

<p>The idea of the service flag is that there shall be a blue star on it for
every person from the home, store or factory in active service in the army
or navy of the United States. This person may be a man or a woman—a
soldier, sailor, marine or nurse—or he or she may be a clerk or any other
employee with the army abroad. Not only actual fighting men, but those
who help the fighting men abroad, may have the flag at home.
<p>A silver star placed over the blue star means that the person has been
wounded or gassed, and a gold star over the blue star is in honor of one
killed in the service. Use of the silver stars is limited to those entitled to
the official wound chevron.

<p><center><b>Those Entitled to the Stars.</b></center>

<p>All officers and enlisted men of the Regular Army, Regular Army Reserve,
Officers’ Reserve Corps, Enlisted Reserve Corps, National Guard, National
Guard Reserve, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Naval Militia, Naval Reserve
Force, Marine Corps Reserve, National Naval Volunteers, United
States Guards, and members of the Nurse Corps are entitled to the blue
star. So are all officers and drafted men in the new National Army raised
by the selective service act, all officers of the Public Health Service, all
men transferred from other services by the President to duty with the Army
and Navy, and all army field clerks, and civilian clerks and employees
on duty with military forces detailed for service abroad. The blue
stars are also for men attending officers’ training camps of the army or
navy and men with the allies who enlisted before our entrance into the war.

<p><center><b>No Emblem But a Star.</b></center>

<p>Persons in the reserve forces and home guards are not entitled to the
flag, and no emblems except the blue, silver and gold stars are proper.
Many people are doing good work to help win the war, but as the flag is
intended for those in the military and naval service only, they are not entitled to it.
<p>This means that no service flag may be flown for workers of local and district
draft boards, medical and legal advisory boards, Red Cross, Young
Men’s Christian Association, Knights of Columbus and Jewish Welfare
workers, and members of official war boards, commissions, aid societies, etc.
<p>When flown from a home a husband, son, father or brother may have
a star on the service flag, and even a more distant relative, provided he
was a member of the household. Stars of actual club members may be on
club flags. The flag of a business concern may have stars for members
of the firm and employees.

<p><center><b>Origin of the Service Flag.</b></center>

<p>The service flag, which is not an official flag of the United States Government,
was originated, designed and patented by R. L. Queisser, of Cleveland, O.,
formerly captain of the Machine Gun Company of the Fifth Ohio
Infantry, now the 145th United States Infantry. The captain was retired
from the regiment because of an accident, but two of his sons who were
officers in the National Guard, were still in the service when war with
Germany was declared. The thought that these two sons would be called
to the colors inspired the captain to invent the flag. The idea has become
popular all over the United States.
<p>Nearly all nations of the world are against Germany because they
know her cause is unjust and that she has not acted honestly. The United
States stands for freedom, right honor and justice for herself and for
all the smaller nations that are not strong enough to protect themselves.
She is fighting not only her own battle, but the battle of all the people of
the world who love freedom and an equal chance to live, prosper and be happy.

<b>“The Service Flag.”</b>
In the <i>23rd Annual Report of the American Scenic and Historic
Preservation Society</i> to the Legislature of the State of New York, 1918-04-12,

<blockquote>
<p>In 1917, an entirely new flag came into existence and promises
to become a permanent addition to the number of American flags.
It is called the “service flag,” and is used to indicate that one or
more members of a household, or business house, are in the military
or naval service of the country. The flag is a patented private
invention and has no official standing with the United States
government, but it seems to meet a popular desire and to perform
a peculiar and useful function not performed in any other way.
<p>The standard proportions of the service flag are a width of four
and a length of five units, but as a matter of fact the flags are made
of varying proportions. The design consists of a white center and
red border, the width of the border being about one-third of the
narrow width of the flag. In the center of the white field is a blue
star if one person is in the service, and a corresponding number of
stars if more than one person are in the service. On some flags
hung out by large corporations, on which it is not practicable to
place a star for each person, the stars are arranged in the form of
numbers. For instance, the flag hung across Broadway, New York
City, in front of the American Telephone and Telegraph Building,
bears the number “6861” outlined with stars in the white field.
This flag is 32 by 52 feet in size.
<p>The service flag was designed and patented by Capt. R. L.
Queisser, of Cleveland, Ohio, a business man who was an officer
in the National Guard and served on the Mexican border. The
Chamber of Commerce and the City Council of Cleveland recommended
its use, and it became instantly popular throughout the
country. At the last session of Congress a bill was introduced to
make the flag official, and it was suggested that $50,000 be appropriated
to provide flags for families having sons and daughters in service, but
the pressure of war legislation prevented the passage of the measure.
The Secretary of War, however, gave it recognition to the extent of allowing
a service flag showing the number of civilian employes of the War Department
in the service to be made.
<p>Several suggestions have been made of ways to indicate the death of a person
represented by a blue star. They include the substitution of a black star,
a gold star, or a black-edged blue star on the white field, or the placing
of a white star on the red border.

center, originally one third the width when the flag was used only for families, where it
could scarcely need space for more than a dozen stars, is now made one half the width; the
proportions are as two to three; and the stars are placed with one point up, as in our flag.

<p class="head"><b>Letter to Women’s Committee Commends the Wearing of Simple Badges of Loss.</b>
<p><span class="sc">WASHINGTON,</span> May 25.—President Wilson has approved a suggestion made by
the Women’s Committee of the Council of National Defense that, instead of wearing conventional
mourning for relatives who have died in the service of their country, American women should wear
a black band on the left arm with a gilt star on the band for each member of the family who has
given up his life for the nation. The following letter to Dr.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Howard_Shaw">Anna Howard Shaw</a>,
Chairman of the Women’s Committee, made public today, contains the President’s approval:

<blockquote>
<p class="head">THE WHITE HOUSE.<br>
Washington, May 22, 1918.
<p>My Dear Dr. Shaw: Thank you for your letter of yesterday. I do entirely approve of the
action taken by the Women’s Committee in executive session, namely that a three-inch black
band should be worn, upon which a gilt star may be placed for each member of the family whose
life is lost in the service, and that the band shall be worn on the left arm. I hope and
believe that thoughtful people everywhere will approve of this action, and I hope that you
will be kind enough to make the suggestion of the committee public, with the statement that
it has my cordial indorsement.
<p>Cordially and sincerely yours,<br>
<span class="sc">Woodrow Wilson.</span>
</blockquote>

<p>In an explanatory statement on the subject the Women’s Committee says:
<blockquote>
<p>This action of the committee at this time is prompted by a feeling on their part
that we should determine beforehand the attitude we are to take toward the inevitably
growing death roll of the defenders of our country. The wearing of such insignia will,
they feel, express better than mourning the feeling of the American people that such
losses are a matter of glory rather than of prostrating grief and depression.
<p>For a long time the Women’s Committee has been receiving letters from women urging
some such action on their part. The determined avoidance of mourning by English women
has been much commented on and praised. One woman who advocates this step has four sons
in the service, one of whom has already been killed. She wrote recently: “I know the
costliness of such supreme glory and sacrifice, and have felt both the selfish temptation
to hide my pain behind a mourning that would hold off intrusion and the inspiration and
stimulus of keeping up to my gallant son’s expectation that I should regard his death
as a happy promotion into higher service. Patriotism means such exalted living that
dying is not the harder part.”
<p>The insignia which has been chosen by the Women’s Committee is of a kind that
can readily be made at home out of whatever material can be procured. The band is to be black
and three inches wide—the stars gilt, and one for each member of the family who has lost his
life in service. These stars may be gold, of gilded metal, or satin, or of cloth. The design
will not be patented, and the insignia will never become a commercial article.

<blockquote>
<p>The desire to avoid the usual symbols of mourning on the part of those who have
relatives in the army and especially those who have lost their loved ones in the
country’s service is highly patriotic and to be commended. The constant reminder
of losses and sorrow must tend to depress the spirit of the people and develop a
feeling of helplessness and despair not in keeping with the supreme sacrifices
which our fighting men and toiling women in the field of action are making.
This badge is not so much a symbol of mourning as of the rank of those who have
been counted worthy to make the supreme sacrifice for their country and humanity.

<p>The publication of the following statement issued by Grosvenor B. Clarkson,
director of the United States Council of National Defense, is authorized by the
Council: “The War and Navy Departments having issued a citation to employers who
give assurance that they will gladly take back their old employes who have served
in the armed forces of the United States, it seems fitting that some symbol representing
this attitude on their part should be placed upon the service flag.
<p>“The United States Council of National Defense, therefore, endorses the placing
of the United States shield upon the red border, but no names of individuals or
business firms shall appear anywhere upon the flag. Any employer who sends the
required assurance to the War and Navy Departments through Colonel Arthur Woods,
chairman of the Council’s Emergency Employment Committee for Soldiers and Sailors,
Washington, D. C., can receive the citation, and as soon as the citation is received
such employer is entitled to put the shield upon his flag.
<p>“The shield should appear upon the service flag in the following manner:
If the service flag hangs downward, as in a window, the shield should be at the top;
if the flag flies from a mast the shield should be placed on the border nearest the mast.
In both cases the shield shall be right side up.”
