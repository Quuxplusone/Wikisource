<p><b>“The Billboard Music Popularity Charts, Part XII: Honor Roll of Popular Songwriters, No. 10—John Philip Sousa.”</b>
By Jack Burton. In <i>The Billboard</i> of February 26, 1949,
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OPYDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45">pages 44–45</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>In the field of martial music, John Philip Sousa seems to have been a
child of destiny, since his birthplace, his parentage and his boyhood
environment all combined to shape a career in which he gained great and
lasting fame.

<p>Sousa was born in Washington, D. C., November 6, 1854. His father, a
Portuguese immigrant, was a trombonist with the U. S. Marine Band,
and in the 1860’s the boy saw history in the making as Union troops and
blaring bands marched daily thru the streets of the capital. Washington
at this time was constantly threatened with invasion by Confederate
armies.

<p>[...]

<p><b>Leaves No Heir.</b>

<p>In 1918, Sousa and his old band had headline billing at the New York
Hippodrome during the run of <i>Everything</i>, a musical spectacle for which
the march king composed the score. This was his last public appearance
on the stage or podium save for a few scattered concerts. When he died on
March 6, 1932, at the age of 78, there was no heir to his royal tunic, on
which was pinned the Victorian Cross of Great Britain, the Golden Palms
and Rosette of the French Academy, and other prized decorations.

<p>Perhaps that was just as well, for the jazz band had succeeded the brass
band in the affections of the American people. Sousa’s marches, however,
have an enduring quality that quickens pulses and throws back shoulders
whenever they are played. They are as American as baseball, and will
last as long.
