<p>This is John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Victory</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The text is taken from a typescript in the Paul Bierley
papers in the Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 78 folder 6).
According to Bierley (1984), none of Sousa’s music for <i>The Victory</i> has ever been
found, but this typescript was discovered in his personal library.
<p>This typescript contains only Acts I and II. It refers to a “Prologue”
not appearing in this typescript.
<p>Many corrections have been made quietly. Some larger corrections and issues
are marked in the text <span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.
<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

show a verdant landscape. Large oak tree seen through French window
<span class="sd">L.</span></i>
<p><i><span class="sc">Courtiers</span> and <span class="sc">Rustics</span> gathered
to celebrate the christening of <span class="sc">Princess Innocenza</span>. Also

<span class="sc">Jealousy</span>, <span class="sc">Avarice</span>,
<span class="sc">Conceit</span>, <span class="sc">Deceit</span>, and

and menace the <span class="sc">King</span> and <span class="sc">Queen</span>.
<span class="sc">Amor Proprio</span> approaches the bassinet, uncorks a potion,
and with dramatic lighting and music indicates an evil curse.</i>
<p><i>The beautiful Fairy Queen, <span class="sc">Felicita</span>, now
opposes <span class="sc">Amor Proprio</span>. His minions flee, and he shrinks back.
<span class="sc">Felicita</span> and the <span class="sc">Good Fairies</span> overpower him.
<span class="sc">Good Fairies</span> force him out through the window and bundle him,
struggling, into the heart of the oak tree, where he disappears.</i>
<p><i><span class="sc">Felicita</span>, at bassinet, indicates that she cannot
lift the curse but she can at least offer her own gift: a magic ring. Places ring
on baby <span class="sc">Innocenza’s</span> finger. <span class="sc">King</span>
sorrowful, <span class="sc">Queen</span> distraught. The party breaks up. Exeunt omnes.

<h3>Scene I.</h3>
<p><i><span class="sc">Time.</span>—Twenty years later. Late afternoon in early fall.</i>
<br><i><span class="sc">Place.</span>—A leafy glade in the royal park.
In the background the walls of a cottage are seen: the
house of the gatekeeper.</i>

<p>[<i>Enter a <span class="sc">Crowd of Harvesters</span>, returning from the field.
Some are dancing, others walking and talking.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
Fine weather for the harvest work.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Rustic</span>
Yes, and for our Lady’s birthday ball.

<p><span class="sc dr">Third Rustic</span>
If it do but last till then.

<p><span class="sc dr">Peasant Woman</span>
It is sure to last.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
And why, then?

<p><span class="sc dr">Peasant Woman</span>
Because our Princess is good to everybody and even the
weather is good to her. Did you never notice how she is
always favored with fine weather when she gives parties?

<p><span class="sc dr">Fourth Rustic</span>
Dost think the weather has a mind?

<p><span class="sc dr">Peasant Woman</span>
Our good King and Queen say everything has a mind; that we
are all part of the Great Mind.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Rustic</span>
They treat us all like that.

<p><span class="sc dr">Peasant Woman</span>
Yes, just as if we were as good as any.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
It makes one love God more when folks are kind.

<p>[<i>The <span class="sc">Rustics</span> begin to dance; others join them.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Third Rustic</span>
Pipe up a tune, sonny, and let us all dance a bit.

<p><span class="sc dr">Fourth Rustic</span>
Yes, we must limber up our joints for the Princess’ ball.

<p>[<i>A lad with some simple musical instrument begins to
play. Orchestra plays a rustic dance. All the people
join in picturesque folk-dance. As the dance is concluded,
one elderly man speaks.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
It seems but a span since the Princess’ christening ball.
I do remember it well.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
That was twenty years ago.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
Our land was very prosperous then.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Rustic</span
It is now.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
Yes, but we never knew a day’s unhappiness then, and there
has been much uneasiness since the night Amor Proprio was
liberated from the oak tree.

<p><span class="sc dr">Third Rustic</span>
He has done no harm yet.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
No, save that he has marred the peace of mind of the King
and Queen regarding the Princess.

<p><span class="sc dr">Fourth Rustic</span>
She must always be attended by someone, they say.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
She is never alone one instant. They fear otherwise
Amor Proprio’s curse may fall.

<p>[<i>Enter a group of <span class="sc">Peasants</span>, who pause in animated
conversation.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">First Peasant</span>
They say Disinteresso seized a mad dog by the throat and
saved the life of a poor child this morning.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Peasant</span>
I hear many such things of him. He must be brave and kind.

<p><span class="sc dr">Third Peasant</span>
Ah, you may be sure he is not all he is said to be.

<p><span class="sc dr">Fourth Peasant</span>
Nobody is; not the best or the worst.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Peasant</span>
The child he saved from the dog has a rich godfather; perhaps
he knew of this.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">First Peasant</span> [<i>angrily</i>]</span>
This lad Disinteresso is not a man like yourself.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second <span class="unclear" title="Thus in 78.6; the conversation moves seamlessly from the newly arrived Peasants back to the original Rustics">Rustic</span></span>
You think this Disinteresso an angel, then.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
No, a thing more needed on earth—a man!

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Rustic</span>
He is but one. Yes, one, but different from the many.

<p><span class="sc dr">Third Rustic</span>
He has a good word for everybody; an open palm lined with
coin for the needy; and a double fist for the oppressed.

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Mentitore</span>.
All <span class="unclear" title="curtsy">courtesy</span> to him. He conducts himself in the manner
of a haughty sovereign. He has overheard mention of
Disinteresso.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
You were talking of the youth Disinteresso, a conceited
coxcomb, as I understand, full of pretty poses and always
playing to the gallery. Let no one take him seriously.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
You must take a man seriously when he risks his life for
others.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>sneeringly</i>]</span>
None do it save for some self-seeking purpose.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
I do not believe that.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
But it is true, nevertheless, and right as true. Men should
be self-seeking.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
By what argument can you convince us of that?

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
The progress of the world. All great achievements have come
from man seeking some selfish end—glory, gold, or power.

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
Disinteresso sought none of the three when he saved the
peasant’s child from the mad dog.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
Nor when he saved a lad from drowning.

<p><span class="sc dr">Fourth Rustic</span>
Nor when he stripped off his coat on a bitter day to wrap a
poor old woman from the cold.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
And he a country lad, too, like many of us, and with no coats
to spare.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
All deeds for theatrical effect. He would love to hear you
talk about it.

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
We would love to have him hear us. We are proud of him.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
Why praise a man who does the thing he likes to do?

<p><span class="sc dr">Old Man</span>
We praise him for liking to do brave deeds.

<p><span class="sc dr">Second Rustic</span>
I agree with my lord Mentitore. He had some axe to grind.
All men are alike.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Old Man</span> [<i>looking at <span class="sc">Mentitore</span></i>]</span>
I would commit suicide if I believed myself to be like some
men.

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Disinteresso</span>.
<span class="sc">Mentitore</span> looks at him disdainfully.
Several <span class="sc">Rustics</span> led by <span class="sc">Old Man</span> approach him with friendly
greetings.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Rustics</span>
Well done, my lad.—We are proud of you, my son.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>insultingly</i>]</span>
Are you just arrived from some great deed of valor, brave
youth?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Disinteresso</span> [<i>with surprise</i>]</span>
I? Why, no; I am from the harvest field.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
Then you are bound on some rescue of the oppressed, no doubt.

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
I fail to understand you.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>with insulting look and tone</i>]</span>
I have been told that your whole life was given to saving
children and old people from dangerous situations.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Old Man</span> [<i>to <span class="sc">Mentitore</span></i>]</span>
Take care! He has been known to deal roughly with ugly dogs.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Disinteresso</span>
[<i>ignoring the insult of <span class="sc">Mentitore</span>, abruptly turns
away and speaks to a group of <span class="sc">Rustics</span></i>]</span>
I was told the Princess would pass this way, on a visit to
the sick daughter of the gatekeeper. I hoped I might be so
favored as to catch a glimpse of her. Has she arrived?

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
She went into the house half an hour ago with her attendant.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span>
[<i>who has been listening, swaggers up and speaks haughtily</i>]</span>
I was sent here by His Majesty the King to watch over the
Princess. There is need of no other.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Disinteresso</span>
[<i>still ignoring him, speaks to the group</i>]</span>
I am told she is passing fair.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Rustics</span> [<i>in one voice</i>]</span>
She is angelic, lovely, beautiful.

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
I hope it may be my good fortune to see her when she comes
forth.

<p>[<i>At this moment flames leap from the roof of the gatekeeper’s
house. Cries for help are heard and excited people run about the house.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
The Princess is in the burning house.
She is calling for help to save the sick child. Who will
go to the rescue?

<p>[<i>The group of <span class="sc">Rustics</span> led by <span class="sc">Disinteresso</span> hasten to the
house. <span class="sc">Mentitore</span> brings up the rear. <span class="sc">Princess</span> is seen
at an upper window, holding the child in her arms.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">First Rustic</span>
Leap from the window. We will catch you.

<p><span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
I cannot leave the sick girl here to die. You must save
her before I go to safety.

<p>[<i>Flames increase.</i>

<p>[<i><span class="sc">Disinteresso</span> rushes into the house and comes out, bearing
in his arms the sick child, who is taken in charge by the
<span class="sc">Rustics</span>, then re-enters and brings out the <span class="sc">Princess</span> in his
arms. She has fainted. <span class="sc">Disinteresso</span> bends over her; his
face is illuminated. Music symbolizing the Awakening of
Love is played.</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>approaching in anger</i>]</span>
How dare you lay your hands upon a Princess of the blood?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Disinteresso</span>
[<i>ignoring him, still gazing at the <span class="sc">Princess</span>, who opens
her eyes; says ecstatically</i>]</span>
My Princess!

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
Fool! I demand the Princess as my charge.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Princess</span>
[<i>smiling at <span class="sc">Disinteresso</span></i>]</span>
Where is the gatekeeper’s daughter?

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
She is in safe hands, unharmed by the flames.

<p><span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
Will you take me to the palace?

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
If you will permit me.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>pushing him aside</i>]</span>
Princess, your royal sire commissions me to guide you safely
back to the palace.

<span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
Yet it was this youth who saved me from the flames.
Surely he should take me to my royal sire and receive
thanks and his reward.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mentitore</span>
He is a common peasant, not suited to be your escort.
Here, lad, take this.

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
I ask no reward but the happiness of having served my Princess.

 Greetings, good friends and citizens. Your King
 Welcomes his children to this festive scene.
 The last occasion of such note as this
 Was when your Princess first received her name
 And Fairies gathered to bestow their gifts.
 Since then our Land of Once-Upon-a-Time
 Has grown and prospered; free from class disputes,
 Because we meet as brothers. Hands that toil
 Clasp hands that govern; and on this great day
 Your happy king proclaims you all his kin.
 My sons and daughters, I do welcome you.

 So vast your bounty, we must all grow old
 Before the half of it could well be told.
 And under weight of good deeds you bestow,
 The curse of Amor Proprio’s laid low.
 Where good seeds fall, good harvest there must grow.

There she is.—Our Princess approaches.—How beautiful!

leaves in her hair and a single red rose at her
corsage. As she enters the guests talk amongst themselves.</i>]

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Guests</span> [<i>variously</i>]</span><br>
She still wears the red rose.<br>
Is the rose her favorite flower?<br>
Oh, don’t you know the meaning of it?<br>
No, what is it?<br>
It is the symbol of her love.<br>
The symbol?<br>
She is to bestow it upon the man of her choice.<br>
Yes, and it is said the King has asked her to bestow it
tonight upon her favorite.<br>
Every Prince in the neighboring lands has asked for her
hand.<br>
But she has refused them all.<br>
I have heard it said that Mentitore feels he has been
encouraged.<br>
That is impossible. Light cannot select Darkness for
a mate.<br>
But Light can make Darkness white and then it is a suitable
consort.<br>
But it is whispered she has never forgotten the peasant
lad who saved her life at the fire.<br>
Yes, and she often walks down that same road, as if hoping
to see him again.<br>
Absurd! Our Princess could not love a peasant lad.<br>
And why not? Her father levels all ranks. See how
he welcomes us all here. One is as good as another.<br>
Yes, he ever says it is deeds and hearts, not titles and
rank, which count in his estimation.<br>
Yet I think he would not like his Princess to marry a
peasant.<br>
He would not like her to marry Mentitore.<br>
But Mentitore is a Prince.<br>
A Prince of Selfishness and Deceit. Heaven save our
Princess from such a fate.<br>
Mentitore is much in love with her. When a man is really
in love, he can win if he persists.<br>
Mentitore loves no one but himself. He would not love
the Princess were she a poor girl.

Oh, yes; a bad man, Amor Proprio, threatened some

Well, we will humor you, my child. From now until the

Then you have some very unkind feeling for me, which you

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
I am hiding something in my heart, it is true. Something

<p><span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
I promise to forgive you. There are to be no secrets

my whims are to be granted.

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
And it is your whim to know what I am hiding in my heart?

<p><span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
Yes, tell me.

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
That which I have to tell came quickly, but it should be
told slowly.

<p><span class="sc dr">Princess</span>
Slowly?

<p><span class="sc dr">Disinteresso</span>
Because each word will be so charged with God’s most wonderful
message to the world, that it would be sacrilege
to speak them quickly.

<h3>Scene I.</h3>
<p><i><span class="sc">Scene.</span>—<span class="sc">Amor Proprio’s</span> home in Evil Land.
In the background is a grim, gray castle.
In the foreground nettles, stubble, and stunted shrubbery.
The whole setting expresses negation and is a vivid contrast
to the beauty that has gone before.
As the curtain rises, we see the companions of <span class="sc">Amor Proprio</span>—<span class="sc">Jealousy</span>,
<span class="sc">Avarice</span>, <span class="sc">Conceit</span>,
<span class="sc">Deceit</span>, and <span class="sc">Temper</span>—doing a wild,
contorted dance round a fire.</i>

<div class="song">
<p><span class="left sc">Deceit</span> I am the master of craft;
 &emsp; My voice is seductive and sweet;
 And I lie with such ease it is certain to please
 &emsp; The gullible people I meet.
<p><span class="left sc">Temper</span> My forte is to frighten and scare;
 &emsp; I bluster and bully and shout.
 And I act so like sin my foes all give in,
 &emsp; For I finally frazzle them out.
<p><span class="left sc">Avarice</span> My way is to listen and watch,
 &emsp; I am silent and deep as the grave;
 I have only one plan—to get all I can—
 &emsp; And to save and to save and to save.
<p><span class="left sc">Jealousy</span> When people have pleasure, or place,
 &emsp; Or learning, or honors, or wealth,
 I search till I find something mean or unkind
 &emsp; And I hunt them and hurt them by stealth.
<p><span class="left sc">Conceit</span> Oh, these are but puppets who talk;
 &emsp; They lack all discretion and wit;
 I am sure it is plain that I have the brain;
 &emsp; In truth all must see <em>I am It</em>.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> We are the baleful band
 &emsp; Serving our Master, Amor Proprio;

<p><span class="dr sc">Jealousy</span>
Our Master tarries late; why did he not take me out into the
big world with him?

<p><span class="dr sc">Conceit</span>
A fine companion you’d make for him. You, indeed! It was
I who should have been with him.

<p><span class="dr sc">Temper</span>
You! You’d make him so vain of his triumphs, he’d tell them
to everyone and that would be his ruination.

<p><span class="dr sc">Deceit</span>
Triumphs! How do we know he’s going to have any? He does
not always succeed.

<p><span class="dr sc">Temper</span>
You talk <span class="unclear" title="TSV: ”much“">mush</span> against our Master when he is not here, but you
cringe to him when he is about.

<p><span class="dr sc">Jealousy</span>
Even he cannot accomplish what he sets out to do on this
journey, I’ll be bound. What an idea to believe he can capture
the Princess Innocenza. She’s too carefully guarded;
he can’t do it, I’m sure.

<p><span class="dr sc">Conceit</span>
No, not without me.

<p><span class="dr sc">Temper</span>
He’s been gathering up strength from me for twenty-one years;
think when that vengeance strikes. Ha! ha! If only I could
be there to see it!

us. None of you has asked me if I succeeded.

Silence! I would speak! I have her; she is mine at last.
What shall we do with her?

<p><span class="dr sc">Avarice</span>
You should hold her for big ransom.

<p><span class="dr sc">Temper</span>
The girl should be killed at once.

<p><span class="dr sc">Deceit</span>
No, first make her think she is a Queen and we will all bow

<p> Heart of my heart, awake from thy sleeping;
 Soul of my soul, come again to my keeping;
 &emsp; Let fond arms enfold thee,
 &emsp; Let dear eyes behold thee,
 &emsp; &emsp; Heart of my heart.
<p> Dark were the days when I could not perceive thee;
 Never again in this world would I leave thee;
 &emsp; Waken and cling to me,
 &emsp; Smile when I sing to thee,
 &emsp; &emsp; Heart of my heart.
<p><span class="left"><span class="sc">Princess</span> [<i>awakes and sings</i>]</span>
 Out of the underworld where hate had walled me
 Into love’s wonderland thy voice has called me.
 &emsp; Since thou art near to me,
 &emsp; Life is now dear to me,
 &emsp; &emsp; Heart of my heart.
<p><span class="left sc">Disinteresso</span> I would hear once again from thy sweet lips
 The story of thy love; what means that word to thee?
<p><span class="left sc">Princess</span> Love is in all things; all things are in love;
 Love is the earth, the sea, the skies above.
 Love is the bird, the blossom, and the wind.
 Love has a million eyes, yet love is blind.
 Love is a tempest, awful in its might.
 Love is the silence of the moonlit night.
 Love is the aim of every human soul,
 And he who hath not love has missed life’s goal.
<p><span class="left sc">Disinteresso</span> Would I were monarch of this whole round earth;
 Then only could I match thy priceless worth.
<p><span class="left sc">Princess</span> When woman loves one born of lowly state,
 Her thought gives crown and sceptre to her mate.
 Yet be he king, or chief of some great clan,
 She loves him but as woman loves a man.
 Monarch or peasant, ’tis the same, I wis,
 When once she gives him love’s surrendering kiss.

<p><span class="dr sc">First Courtier</span>
No word from the messengers concerning our Princess.

<p><span class="dr sc">Second Courtier</span>
No; and all have returned but one, saying the search is hopeless.

No; two, sir, are yet to be heard from.

<p><span class="dr sc"><span class="unclear" title="Inserted on my own authority">Second</span> Courtier</span>
Two?

<p><span class="dr sc"><span class="unclear" title="Inserted on my own authority">First Court</span> Lady</span>
The knight Nobilito, who journeyed to the south, and Mentitore,
who went north.

<p><span class="dr sc">First Courtier</span>
What a calamity should <em>he</em> prove the rescuer of our Lady.

<p><span class="dr sc">Second Courtier</span>
The King would be obliged to give the Princess in marriage.

<p><span class="dr sc"><span class="unclear" title="Inserted on my own authority">First</span> Courtier</span>
He has given his royal promise.

<p><span class="dr sc">Second Court Lady</span>
Surely the Fairies who watch over her will save her from
such a fate.

<p><span class="dr sc">First Court Lady</span>
Her God-mother, Felicita, will protect her.

Alas, no news, your Majesty.

 In mansions, convents, caves, and even in
 The records of the dead throughout this land,
 But I have heard no word, and seen no look,
 And felt no instinct which has guided me
 To any clue of this dark mystery.
 It is with shame and sorrow infinite
 I make this answer to you, oh my King.

 Into the region of the Things-We-Know.
<p> Faith is not Faith till the heart is shaken;
 Faith is not Faith till joy is taken;
 Faith is not Faith till the soul stands stark
 And nude and alone with itself in the dark.
 So stands my soul in this desolate hour;
 But Faith is beside it and gives it power.
 Though black are the shadows through which I grope
 And the skies show never a star of hope,
 Faith lends my vision a deeper sight;
 And lo, beyond me, the Light, the Light!

The curse, the curse! The curse fulfilled at last.

<p><span class="dr sc">Mentitore</span>
The curse, alas, too true. And Fate was wily as she ofttimes
is, and chose a comely youth to further her design.

The youth she chose as partner in the dance.

Surely that kindly lad meant her no harm.

<p><span class="dr sc">Mentitore</span>
Fate often chooses seeming innocence to mislead innocence. So
was it here; this lad bewitched your daughter; he was but a
tool of Amor Proprio, our life-long foe.

<p><span class="dr sc">King</span>
We have dispensed with all formalities. Bring her at once
to our impatient arms.

<p><span class="dr sc">Mentitore</span>
Sire, as you will; I thought if you but knew that she is
safe that would suffice; she is much bedraggled by her journey.
She would appear before you in attire suited to her estate.

<p><span class="dr sc">Queen</span>
That sounds not like our Innocenza. She does not place false
emphasis on outward forms. I am afraid.

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">King</span> [<i>sternly</i>]</span>
Mentitore, have you told us only truth?

<p><span class="dr"><span class="sc">Mentitore</span> [<i>with assumed innocence</i>]</span>
And you ask that, of one who risked his life to save your child?

<p><span class="dr sc">King</span>
Your pardon; but you know the olden prophecy of the name Mentitore.
It signifies False Evidence. We would change that
name in recognition of your valiant deed, before you claim
our daughter as your bride. Now bring her to us; we have
waited long.

<p><span class="dr sc">Mentitore</span>
This is the youth who used the arts of magic to bewitch
your child. He was the tool of Amor Proprio.

<p><span class="dr sc">Princess</span>
His words are false; this is the man I love; and his the hand
that slew your mortal foe.

<p><span class="dr sc">Mentitore</span>
The Princess is bewitched; this youth has evil powers.
