<h4>I.</h4>

<p><i>“His Light shineth in darkness.”</i>

<div class="poem"><p>The new-made sun, when nature all was hushed,
 Revealed his glory in the eastern sky;
Earth virgin-like in his grand presence blushed,
 As though the great Creator now were nigh!
<p>Then was disturbed the sleep of ancient night,
 Her sable pinions trembled as with fear;
And from the vast expanse she took her flight,
 Full conscious that the sun’s approach was near.
<p>For a brief time the stars in fair array
 All gazed in admiration at the sight;
And with their wings, while dawning was the day,
 In pure reverence hid their faces bright.
<p>Expectantly in chaos’ dullest reign<a id="p6"><span class="pagenum">p6</span></a>
 For light’s remotest sign Earth looked so long;
As now the sun made his appearance fine,
 Earth sang with all the stars creation’s song!
<p>The billows of the deep to see the spell
 Themselves upheaved as in a gentle fray;
Alternately the surges backward fell,
 As they rose rushing to salute the day!
<p>The modest meads above the waters rose,
 And Nature, all enchanted, upright stood;
The forward hills up from their long repose
 Awoke to gaze upon the shining flood.
<p>The mountains and the valleys that were made
 Were rising from the void as from a sea
To be adorned with herbs and the green blade
 By the sun’s warmth which nurseth life so free.
<p>Earth’s docile waters went with murmuring rare
 And formed the rivers, seas, and oceans high;
The dry land freely breathed the quickening air,
 While its tall summits climbed the crystal sky.
<p>The tender soil beneath the fervent heat<a id="p7"><span class="pagenum">p7</span></a>
 Brought forth abundant grass by God’s command;
And Nature’s graceful sway with flowers sweet
 Decked all the surface of the smiling land.
<p>The densest fog, that intervened between
 The sun and earth, had vanished all away,
And in his lustrous splendor now was seen
 The fruitful Earth rejoicing in his ray.
<p>For times as countless as the sparkling dew,
 In mist the sun did set, remote from Earth;
When now so near, his presence he withdrew,
 Deprived Earth was of her exultant mirth.
<p>While sadly weeping for the missing light,
 The moon and stars in solemn silence came,
As from a holier region into sight,
 To comfort lonely Earth with meeker flame.
<p>The sun returned in a diviner gleam,
 As from the glare of suns of higher mould;
Earth with a kinder smile received his beam
 Than since she had emerged from Chaos old.
<p>Another kingdom through the lowest one<a id="p8"><span class="pagenum">p8</span></a>
 Crept, walked, and played, endowed with instinct keen;
And while ascending on his turn, the sun
 Rained on them all his warmth and varied sheen.
<p>While o’er the flowery fields behemoth went,
 Beneath his weight they seemed to bend to dales;
As in the stream he stretched himself content,
 It backward ran, submerging all the vales.
<p>The mighty seas with life were teeming now,
 And smoothly through the waves it made its way;
The whale above the surface raised his brow,
 And sent the waters streaming to the sky.
<p>As a new planet populous, complete,
 Earth now in vain was searching for her king.
To occupy the throne in the retreat
 Of Paradise, where reigned eternal spring.
<p>As usual now the dawn unlocked the gate
 Of joyous, radiant day and beauty rare;
The sov’reign sun, while forth he came in state,
 Revealed the <em>Man</em> enthroned in Eden fair.
<p>The seventh day, most blessèd, perfect rest,<a id="p9"><span class="pagenum">p9</span></a>
 The only Sabbath ever was, may be,
That Satan bold hath not annoyed the breast
 That worships God in holy <span class="corrected" title="ecstacy">ecstasy!</span>
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Again, the sun arose and Nature smiled,
 As smiles a babe that wakes from restful sleep;
But man in crime and fear appearèd wild;
 He wished the sun had never left the deep!
<p>Of good and evil he had tasted now,
 As we through childhood pass to riper years;
The brightest crown that decked a human brow
 He had exchanged for shame and bitter tears!
<p>He would have hid in darkness and in night,
 Sin held the heights were Innocence had trod;
Remorse and guilt in darkness will delight,
 But purity of heart delights in God.
<p>The sense of sin, the consciousness of wrong,<a id="p10"><span class="pagenum">p10</span></a>
 The source of all our weakness insecure,
Was like a tide arising in him strong,
 While now he thought of Him who made him pure!
<p>As night retreats before the dawn of day,
 As God’s approach man hid himself in fear;
But mercy’s first and most pathetic lay,
 The voice of God found his unwilling ear!
<p>The wretched fallen man was found by grace,
 For God is love—let heaven and earth rejoice!
The way of blessèd life to all the race
 Was pointed by the Lord’s inquiring voice.
<p><em>The Promised One</em> shall bruise the serpent’s head,
 What depth of life contians the Promise free!
Though by the Tempter vanquished, sinful, dead,
 Man in the Promised One shall victor be!
<p>And by the Promise prime the love of God
 Shone like the new-made sun of ancient day
In the dull night which darkened Eden’s sod,
 And cheered the man o’ercome by dire dismay.
<p>It bridged the dreadful gulf that Sin had made,<a id="p11"><span class="pagenum">p11</span></a>
 Dividing God and man—his youngest child;
And, also, it dispelled the fatal shade
 That hid from his God’s gracious presence mild.
<p>The Promise hath a voice more potent, kind,
 Than the creative word “Let there be light”;
It caused the star of hope to Adam’s mind
 To rise in its celestial glory bright.
<p>As he from Eden’s sacred heights was sent,
 Despoiled of sanctity and gifts unseen,
With him the first and richest Promise went,
 To make his future bearable, serene.
<p>Though guarded is the way of life’s fair tree,
 And shut the golden gates of Paradise;
Though sin’s results sweep over land and sea,
 The Promise points the man to calmer skies.
<p>Though fowl and beast their cruelty have shown,
 And wrath’s stern angel in the sky resides,
Though clouds flash lightnings and dull thunders groan,
 Yet man looks upward where his God abides.
<p>Though dimmer is the night and all her train,<a id="p12"><span class="pagenum">p12</span></a>
 And paler now the brightness of the sun,
Though heaven and earth are quaking as in pain,
 Man may find comfort in the Promised One.
<p>Though intellect is dull and passions boil,
 And conscience pricks and love perverted is,
Though tilling daily the unyielding soil,
 Man in the Promise may find rest and bliss.
<p>Angelic innocence and ease are past,
 And converse with Jehovah face to face;
Still helpful hope remains in error’s blast
 Of true communion with the Lord by grace.
<p>He sorely recollects in grosser clime
 The milder day when first himself he knew;
How changed his state from that enraptured time,
 When Eden’s glory dazzled on his view!
<p>Though heaven from Earth seems further to have gone,
 And seldom on the breeze spreads angel’s wing,
Though exiled, sin-stained, of himself undone,
 Supported by the Promise man can sing.
<p>Jehovah in his truthful Promise dwells<a id="p13"><span class="pagenum">p13</span></a>
 To succor, to enlighten, and to cheer;
And man—a sinner—in the Promise spells
 That he who seeks the Lord will find him near.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>God’s precious Promise!—the Redeemer’s star,
 Aurora, hail!—haste, usher in the day;
Salvation in its essence from afar
 Beams in thy gracious, empyreal ray!
<p>As guides the morning star the traveller’s feet,
 Ere comes the sun the firmament to span,
So safely guided by the Promise sweet
 And lesser lustres was the mind of man.
<p>The Book of Nature,—heaven, land, and sea,
 Charmed, like the serpent’s eye, the observer keen;
And man by nature may observant be,
 And find the Author in what’s known and seen.
<p>The Voice of Conscience,—that mysterious strain,<a id="p14"><span class="pagenum">p14</span></a>
 Which with prompt aptness recommends the light,
Claimed for the truth its native right to reign,
 And form the character of man aright.
<p>The Fall’s stern Lesson,—that most fatal turn,
 Which soils the records of the human race,
The which effects triumphantly would burn,
 Had God left man unaided by his grace.
<p>Creative ancient Lore,—to man revealed,
 Conveyed by sire to son from age to age;
The truth by honest minds was not concealed,
 But wholly spoken by each pious sage.
<p>O mean of God! with holy warmth aglow,
 Each in his period by the Spirit taught,
Taught what they knew or what in vision saw,
 Truth’s noblest teachers of sublimest note!
<p>These were the lights, but in the centre hung
 The Promise fair, supreme in kind and scope;
And from the love of Godhead it had sprung,
 Portraying man’s Avenger and his Hope.
<p>When sun is set, the moon and stars retrace<a id="p15"><span class="pagenum">p15</span></a>
 Their nightly course to brighten earth and sky;
And oh! when God withdrew his radiant face,
 In tenderness his Promise sparkled nigh!
<p>And in the presence of the lesser lights,
 And the potential Promise, man went forth,
And in him all the race, to climb the heights
 From which he fell, and reach his native worth.
<p>How steep the rugged mount, how rough the road,
 While the subtle beast is crouching by the way;
And of alluring mood in every mode,
 Moved by insatiate lust to seize the prey.
<p>The origin of sin, the fertile root,
 Dark Jealousy—infernal, cunning lust,
Watching its hour, then, as to frenzy wrought,
 It strikes the innocent victim to the dust.
<p>Alas! the lad devout,—one of a twain,
 Who of true heart brought choicest sacrifice,
Now by his brother of sheer malice slain,
 So ever would the fool dispatch the wise!
<p>His guiltless soul soared on the wings of love,<a id="p16"><span class="pagenum">p16</span></a>
 To Him he served with most sincere desire;
And lo! new notes were struck through realms above—
 Redemption’s anthem by the angelic choir!
<p>The slayer from the presence of the Lord,—
 His father’s house, God in the human heart,
Was driven sternly forth, as by the sword
 Of righteous indignation, to a land apart.
<p>The benign God who watches o’er the flower
 That blooms and withers in the waste obscure,
Will fain endow the struggling soul with power
 To walk with him and all his cares endure.
<p>To walk with God man’s highest aim should be,
 All earthly honor soon shall pass away;
But they who ground themselves in piety
 Secure a fame that never shall decay.
<p>To walk with God is privilege supreme,
 The grandest movement of the human soul;
By meditating on the ideal theme,
 The soul at last shall reach its destined goal.
<p>Lo! “Enoch walked with God, and he was not;<a id="p17"><span class="pagenum">p17</span></a>
 For God took him” to dwell among the blest;
He cast aside his last imperfect spot
 On some dark cloud as he went Home to rest.
<p>The Promise proved to him a tree of life,
 From which he picked immortal fruit by faith;
And having conquered every human strife,
 He soared to bliss above the vale of death!
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>There was a star hung on the brow of night,
 There was a path from darkness into day,
Whereby the penitential spirit might
 Perceive the truth and know its righteous way.
<p>But yet the flow of sin had risen high,
 And bore upon its flood the chosen seed;
Corruption swayed, all flesh had gone astray,
 It was the reign of violence and greed.
<p>The Spirit of Jehovah turned aside,<a id="p18"><span class="pagenum">p18</span></a>
 And as in bitter disappointment wept;
And ever upward swelled the furious tide,
 And fierce against the purposes of God it swept!
<p>The Spirit will not always strive with man,
 Abandoned by the Lord, how sad his state;
Impelled by evil thoughts, how soon he saw
 His sinful course and met his fearful fate!
<p>The faithful man—one of the righteous race
 Who in the heinous age most worthy stood,
Found in the eyes of God redeeming grace;
 He and his house escaped the deadly flood.
<p>The ark! the ark! the refuge of the brave,
 Divinely planned, but built by human skill:
Man is more mighty than the wrathful wave
 When he with God co-operates at will.
<p>Ah! Noah’s admonitions were in vain;
 The precious load is sealed within the ark;
And Nature holds her breath, as in deep pain,
 And lo! the east at break of day is dark!
<p>Chaotic silence reigns in every nook,<a id="p19"><span class="pagenum">p19</span></a>
 And birds of prey mid flight fall dead with fear;
And flocks and herds, astounded, upward look,
 As if they knew that their end was near!
<p>But oh! the tremblings of the human heart,
 The wailings of the myriads rend the air;
And not a ray of hope the skies impart;
 It is too late for tears—too late for prayer!
<p>They envied now the creatures of the ark,
 Obediently at Noah’s call they came;
Each took its place by instinct in the bark,
 And the ferocious for the time were tame.
<p>While envying thus the creatures their strong-hold,
 A denser darkness gathered all around;
Ere long a fatal storm all signs foretold,
 And clouds of thunder settled on the ground!
<p>Jehovah now sends forth his vengeful ire,
 A mortal tremor apprehends the earth;
The thunderbolts, as massive bars of fire,
 Burst the fraught clouds and give the Deluge birth.
<p>A cataract of rain each cloud outpours,<a id="p20"><span class="pagenum">p20</span></a>
 O’er values and meads in solid flow it drives;
Anow the oceans overleap their shores,
 And blackest death on human beings thrives!
<p>The Deluge onward leads his surging train,
 And moaning, upward swells, all white with wrath;
With a victorious roar the stormy main
 Makes all the highest mounts his easy path!
<p>Thrown open were the floodgates of the sky,
 And broken were the fountains of the deep;
The righteous God in judgment did pass by,
 And Earth, redeemed by flood, falls now to sleep.
<p>But piloted by God the loaded ark
 On the majestic waters smoothly goes;
To note her course there’s not the slightest mark,
 The sole survivor of a flood of woes!
<p>The gentle breezes, as the breath of God,
 O’er all the surface dark begin to blow;
And calmly backward, at the Almighty’s nod,
 To their alloted bounds the waters go.
<p>The God who called the elements to war,<a id="p21"><span class="pagenum">p21</span></a>
 Spoke to the troubled Deluge—“Peace, be still.”
The truth-containing ark floats to the bar,
 And rests on Ararat’s exalted hill.
<p>Out of the waters, as it did of yore,
 The earth emerges as in joy and peace.
To be destroyed by deluge never more,
 Till the last day the seasons shall not cease.
<p>Sweet smelling odors from the altar rise,
 And Noah triumphed by the Promised Light;
The sign of covenant shines in the skies,
 The beamy, <span class="corrected" title="varied-colored">vari-colored</span> rainbow bright!
</div>

<h3>Canto II.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The race survives! the upright wins the meed;
 Victoriously he crossed the raging flood,
And guided by the Light he will proceed
 To combat evil and to love the good.
<p>Hail! Holy Light, the Uncreated Word,<a id="p22"><span class="pagenum">p22</span></a>
 Throughout the ages in the darkness, shine,
Until in human form thou wilt, O Lord,
 Expound thyself to man as truth divine!
<p>But self-willed man, <span class="corrected" title="presumptious">presumptuous</span> and vain,
 By evil disposition ever driven,
Attempts, as e’er, unaided to attain
 A perfect safety and a glorious heaven!
<p>While thus attempting his own fate to mould,
 And build his structures and the skies ascend,
All his proud systems, as the tower bold,
 In utter Babel—deep confusion end!
<p>Benighted man to worship self resigns,
 Self-love conducts him to the sordid pelf;
And in his false ambition he declines,
 As at the start, the Deity for self!
<p>He doth not worship idols truly so,
 But his fond thought embodied in the form,
He’ll bend the knee and as a suppliant go
 To his thought-image which he deems the norm!
<p>He dreams and dreams, and worships what he dreams,<a id="p23"><span class="pagenum">p23</span></a>
 And his unreal dreams imagines true;
In these he trusts, and leaves the living streams
 Of truth divine for his strange notions new!
<p>Self-idolized and self-deluded man
 From Heaven’s presence vaguely wanders yet;
And from his thoughts excludes the only plan
 Whereon he should his chief affections set.
<p>Hence now from <span class="corrected" title="Shinar">Shinar’s</span> fertile, flowery plain,
 The godless tribes by the divine decree,
Speaking various tongues, are scattered amain
 To people the whole earth from sea to sea.
<p>Each tribe its own peculiar thought pursue,
 Confusing errors with the truths of Heaven;
The earth by skill and courage they subdue,
 But yet to evil and vain-glory given!
<p>As ere the flood, sin <span class="corrected" title="viciates">vitiates</span> the mind,
 And in its blindness into wildness starts;
With reckless rush these tribes of human kind
 Depart from God though guilty conscience smarts.
<p>They leave the Light as they before the flood,<a id="p24"><span class="pagenum">p24</span></a>
 Blind builders of their future men are still;
The means they had—they might have understood
 The statutes of the Everlasting Will.
<p>But there is not an epoch—not an age
 Wherein the human race went all amiss;
Each period had its wise and holy sage
 That led the rest to God and endless bliss.
<p>True heroes of the Light! they lived above
 This earth, and saw what only faith can see;
They saw through space and time the land of love,
 Eternal life and immortality.
<p>Though Noah’s generation quenched the light,
 And in their stubbornness rebellious came;
The family of Eber thought aright,
 And trod the paths that lead to holy fame.
<p>The branches wither, but the stock remains,
 And through the scent of waters bud again;
So human nature its prime stem retains
 And by Divinity it blooms in men.
<p>And Eber bloomed and flourished as a palm,<a id="p25"><span class="pagenum">p25</span></a>
 As Noah his ancestor, as a saint;
He lived above the many in the calm
 That springs from doing good without restraint.
<p>They were not spotless men; but men that strove
 To know the Perfect, worship, and obey;—
Men in close harmony with truth and love,
 Who fought for God while others turned astray.
<p>Behold the moon when fairest is not clear,
 But in the beauty we forget the stains;
In the best lives some blemishes appear,
 We see the blemish, but forget their pains!
<p>Brave men of sterling worth and true renown,
 Who faithfully Jehovah did adore,
Here gained their peace, and an immortal crown
 Beyond the bounds of <span class="corrected" title="time">time’s</span> tempestuous shore.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4><a id="p26"><span class="pagenum">p26</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>Thou Source of holy thought and constant stay,
 The power and fire of the sacred muse,
Teach me thy tuneful strains, approve my lay,
 And into it thy influence infuse!
<p>Idolatry, mankind’s besetting fault,
 Is practised now by God’s most favored race;
Man’s wild imagination, like a bolt,
 Hath left the path of piety and grace.
<p>Each family its darling idols keep,
 The <em>teraphim</em>,—what superstitious trust!
But there is one whose faith is not asleep,
 The father of the faithful and the just.
<p>How frequent now the Voice Supreme is heard,
 Wherever in their sojourns dwell the wise;
How frequent now the Angel of the Lord
 Delights to visit Earth in various guise.
<p>In dreams and visions of the silent night,<a id="p27"><span class="pagenum">p27</span></a>
 When man and nature are at peaceful rest,
The great, illustrious Visitor from light
 Makes his appearance on his high behest.
<p>The Unseen Being in the Angel seeks,
 Assuming form and simple majesty,
The tents of men, and to the Patriarchs speaks,
 As friend to friend in true humility.
<p>He spoke to Adam and with Enoch walked,
 And Noah heard the influential voice;
Again to one the Lord in mercy talked,—
 One in whose seed the nations shall rejoice.
<p>Led by the Light and the divine command,
 To be a stranger on this earthly ball
He leaves his kindred and his native land,
 In true obedience to the heavenly call.
<p>Man’s highest reason and true faith are one,
 Faith is the fruit and reason is the tree,
When Abraham goes his godly course to run,
 Of all the race most rational is he.
<p>Thou man of faith and holy vision, go,<a id="p28"><span class="pagenum">p28</span></a>
 And the Eternal Word will be thy guide;
Go, teach mankind the living God to know,
 And gaze upon thy fair possessions wide.
<p>From Ur of Chaldees, crossing Haran’s ford,
 He and few kindred reached the promised land,
Wherein, at the appointed time, the Lord,
 The Promised One made bare his mighty hand.
<p>The highest Promise of propitious Heaven,
 The prime, the all-sufficient, central one,
Again was to this favored prophet given,
 In that of Isaac—his immediate son.
<p>Hail! Prince of faith, the friend of God, the blest,
 From plain to hill in Canaan he did roam;
And in the Promise found the heavenly rest,
 The Saviour meek and the celestial home.
<p>By his strong faith in God’s great Promise high
 He would have sacrificed his only son,
Had not the Angel from the open sky
 Stayed his firm hand as though the deed were done.
<p>The Angel of the Lord was ever sure<a id="p29"><span class="pagenum">p29</span></a>
 To bless and comfort him as needs might be;
And once, with his attendant angels pure,
 He did adorn his hospitality.
<p>The cogent Promise, like a fixèd star,
 Which lightened all the ages’ darkest night,
Sheds now abroad a brighter lustre far
 Than when it beamed on Eden’s faded light.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Son of the Promise—Isaac, Abraham’s heir,
 Most holy man of God, so meek and wise,
Fit type he is of Him who did appear
 To work his way from Earth to Paradise.
<p>He was a thoughtful meditative soul,
 With nature’s truths conversant—pleasant fields
He could himself in any strait control,
 What lessons of submission Isaac yields.
<p>To him again the glorious Light unveiled<a id="p30"><span class="pagenum">p30</span></a>
 Himself at Geran and the Promise gave;
And full of days, the Patriarch, bewailed
 By his two sons, found rest beyond the grave.
<p>The fulgent Promise’s grand descent through time,
 Till the fulfilment in the Promised One,
Is <span class="unclear" title="[sic]">infinite mor</span> splendid and sublime
 Than the inspiring course of nature’s sun.
<p>By its irradiant gleam through thickest gloom
 The faithful people trod the righteous way;
And heaven-born faith beheld the vernal bloom
 Of that fair world where shines eternal day.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Inscrutable are all Jehovah’s ways,
 Jacob the youngest son the Promise bears;
Though tossed by troubles almost all his days,
 True faith in God his character declares.
<p>When fleeing from his brother Esau’s wrath,<a id="p31"><span class="pagenum">p31</span></a>
 Asleep at Bethel in a lucid dream
He saw from Earth to heaven a sunny path,
 Illumined by Jehovah’s brilliant beam.
<p>O what a vision! what supernal sight!—
 There heaven on earth was present to the eye;
How glorious always is a starry night,
 But then transformed to heaven was all the sky.
<p>The golden ladder lining the ascent,
 The angels moving up and down the steep,
As by Divinity they had been sent
 To guard a lonely pilgrim in his sleep.
<p>He humbly saw and heard the blessèd Lord,
 And clearly felt he had been sought and found;
And, like his fathers, he received the word
 Of sacred Promise in its sweetest sound.
<p>When he awoke, that God was there he knew,
 Bethel, the house of God, called he the place;
And from the hallowed height the pilgrim true
 Pursued his course, sustained by faith and grace.
<p>To them who love to trace the Holy Light,<a id="p32"><span class="pagenum">p32</span></a>
 Who look beyond the valley of despair,
How precious Bethel’s memorable height,
 Where God met Jacob in a vision fair.
<p>Like him each mortal must his Saviour meet
 Ere he begins his character to mend;
And from his Bethel, well-equipped, discreet,
 He will set forth to conquer to the end.
<p>Lo! he who <span class="corrected" title="knowns">knows</span> the Lord he also knows
 The evil of his heart to some degree;
And as self-consciousness expands and grows,
 He fully feels that victor he shall be.
</div>

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem">From Padan-aram to his native land,
 Across the cooling ford of Jabbok’s stream,
The Patriarch returned, led by the hand
 Of Him he met at Bethel in a dream.
<p>The sun was set, the dew fell thick and fast;<a id="p33"><span class="pagenum">p33</span></a>
 And thoughtful night sat on the dusky throne;
There nothing stirred save Jabbok’s stream; at last
 The anxious Patriarch was left alone.
<p>And O! from early night to rosy morn
 He wrestled with a <em>Man</em> in earnest prayers;
He held to him, as to salvation’s horn,
 With fervent supplications and with tears.
<p>And when the struggle did most earnest grow,
 And Jacob the departure did delay,
As mist before the sun, so vanished now
 The Angel’s human form and all was day!
<p>“For breaking is the day,” the Angel said,
 “Let me go,”—the contest had been long and hard;
But fearless faith in Jacob answer made:
 “Thy flight except thou bless me I’ll retard”!
<p>Prevail he did. The Heavenly Being spoke:<a id="p34"><span class="pagenum">p34</span></a>
 “Not Jacob,—Israel shall thy name be called.”
And, while the sun creation’s beauty woke,
 He as a prince with God and man was there installed!
<p>In agony of soul the Patriarch wept,
 While yearning to prevail with the Most High;
The Lord found him in Bathel as he slept,
 But he in Peniel found the Lord for aye.
<p>In fond remembrance of the victory gained,
 Peniel—the face of God—named he the place,
For there the title Israel he obtained,
 And there he saw Jehovah face to face.
<p>He who hath seen the beauty of the Lord,
 A deeper knowledge of him he desires;
And on the dewy mountains of the Word,
 In Peniel he’ll prevail ere he expires!
</div>

<h4>VI.</h4><a id="p35"><span class="pagenum">p35</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>So Israel now confirmed in faith and free
 From burdensome anxiety and fear,
Resumed his homeward march; and, as a sea
 After storm, Esau’s face was calm and clear.
<p>Faith stills the roughest storm that ever blew,
 And on the hill of triumph sets the soul;
The teaching of the Sacred Page is true,—
 He who makes peace with God makes peace with all.
<p>In Canaan then he wandered to and fro,
 A man of trials as he thought the while;
As years passed the Patriarch came to know
 That every cloud was but Jehovah’s smile.
<p>In Goshen, also, by the flowing Nile,
 When fast his life was ebbing to the main,
Inspired by Heaven, he saw the Light the while,
 The coming Shiloh and his glorious reign.
<p>Hail! honored Judah and thy royal tribe,<a id="p36"><span class="pagenum">p36</span></a>
 From thee in time shall come the Promised One;
To him the people shall all praise ascribe
 When his day breaketh as the rising sun.
</div>

<h3>Canto III.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Voice Divine for ages had been mute,
 And prompting Inspiration was suppressed;
The Israelites were now of no repute,
 For in captivity they were oppressed.
<p>Their glorious state and fame in days of old
 Had been forgotten,—sorely they were tried;
And lashed and burdened by the Egyptians bold,
 In anguish daily to the Lord they cried.
<p>Heard was their cry! The All-seeing One above
 Beheld their bondage and their servile plight;
And their grand deliverance planned in love,
 And caused the star of hope to shine so bright.
<p>How wondrous are the purposes of God,<a id="p37"><span class="pagenum">p37</span></a>
 Unfolding like the morning to the view;
When crushed was Israel by an iron rod,
 Then Moses came proud Egypt to subdue.
<p>And lo! by Egypt he was nursed, and trained
 In all the wisdom of that ancient day;
And worthily her glory he maintained
 When leading her strong armies in the fray.
<p>How goodly and how winsome when a child,
 His infant smile won <span class="corrected" title="Pharoah’s">Pharaoh’s</span> daughter’s grace,
And as he grew, he grew in manhood mild,
 He was the meekest man of all the race.
<p>His Hebrew passion in his fortieth year
 Nerved his strong arm to strike a deadly blow
 Too soon as yet! to save thy life, in fear
 To yonder Midian thou must quickly go.
<p>Be patient, wait, control thyself, prepare;<a id="p38"><span class="pagenum">p38</span></a>
 The mind of Him thou servest truly know:
To strike ere the opportune time beware,
 Be sure that God himself inspires thy blow.
<p>One intelligent stroke, directed true,
 By him who sees with single eye the goal,
Will always better execution do
 Than numberless attempts by a dull soul.
<p>Though versed in Egypt’s science and fine art,
 A scholar of the scholars, broad and keen,
He had one task to learn—to know his heart
 And sympathize with Majesty Unseen.
<p>Hail! solitude, fond nurse of finest thought,
 Where earth, sun, moon, and stars in silence sleep,
There to the tops of Horeb he was brought
 To muse in loneliness and watch the sheep.
<p>On that historic mount for forty years<a id="p39"><span class="pagenum">p39</span></a>
 In meditations deep he groped for light;
And for his people felt and wept the tears,
 While growing darker was the weary night.
<p>But Heaven’s long silence shall be broken soon,
 The ray of freedom purples all the sky,
The race shall yet enjoy the brightest noon,
 The Angel of Jehovah hovers nigh.
<p>For he, the highest manhood of mankind,
 In that far age, one day had led the sheep
Back of the desert, and his eagle-mind
 Stood wholly lost in pure reflections deep.
<p>There he beheld a vision strangely fair,
 The bush was burning, yet unscathed remained.
The Angel of the Lord was in the glare,
 The Self-existent who our peace ordained.
<p>Perplexed, he turned to look upon the flame,<a id="p40"><span class="pagenum">p40</span></a>
 Not knowing how to solve such perfect spell;
But when he heard announced the Holy Name,
 He knew the Presence and he prostrate fell.
<p>He heard the mind of Him whose word is sure,
 He knew his weakness and he knew his might;
All might he knew was in the Presence pure,
 In him was darkness; in the Presence—light.
<p>The Light shone in the darkness, and the Might
 Made even Moses’ weakness more than strong;
He by the Presence had the might and right
 To humble Egypt and redress her wrong.
<p>His noble mission now he well did know,
 To God he gave what Egypt wished—his will;
Sweet harmonies through all man’s nature flow
 When God enjoins and man aims to fulfil.
<p>Through life he triumphed by the Presence mild,<a id="p41"><span class="pagenum">p41</span></a>
 As blooming nature triumphs in the spring;
God spoke to him as father to a child,
 And made him great as prophet, priest, and king.

<p><i>“But will God indeed dwell on the Earth?”</i> —1 Kings 8:27.

<div class="poem"><p>Invisible to man thou art, O Lord,
 When wilt thou come to dwell among the race?
That they may hear from three the living word,
 That they may know and see thee face to face.
<p>Thou didst reveal thy counsels in the past,
 At long intervals to the chosen seed;
O wilt thou come to dwell with man at last,
 And know by being man thyself his need?
<p>Thou didst appear in symbol and in sign,
 In dream and vision; in the burning bush;
Wilt thou <span class="corrected" title="forego">forgo</span> thy blessèd state and deign
 To know and feel as man, to smile and blush?
<p>Thou didst, O Lord, in fiery pillar and cloud,<a id="p42"><span class="pagenum">p42</span></a>
 In angel-form on special times appear;
From Horeb once was heard thy voice aloud
 When all the tribes were struck with awe and fear.
<p>Thou mad’st thy dwelling in the holy place,
 For periods long there was thine earthly rest;
When wilt thou come to wear a human face,
 And bear a human heart within thy breast?
<p>How long, how long the world must wait again,
 And through dark types and shadows look at thee,
And be content to follow holy men,
 As straying sparks of thy divinity?
<p>O thou alone canst put all doubt to flight,
 And make man feel that death doth not end all;
For thou wilt bring eternal life to light,
 And show the priceless value of the soul.
<p>Thy first great prophet, Moses, spoke of thee,<a id="p43"><span class="pagenum">p43–44</span></a>
 That thou wouldst come and dwell in human guise,
That man should hearken to thee and be free,
 And take thy yoke upon him and be wise.
<p>When shall “a child” be born, both God and man;—
 Of whom thy holy prophets nobly speak?
When wilt thou come to be the Promised One,
 And bruise the serpent’s head and save the weak?
<p>When wilt thou come to be a man of grief,
 And know the sorrows that humanity bears,
And find by weeping how much calm relief
 To the full breast there is in shedding tears?
<p>O when wilt thou redeem thine oracles old,
 And cause thy chosen people to rejoice,
And bring thine “other sheep” within the fold,
 And teach them all to know thy tender voice?
<p>Each harmless dove and lamb, that e’er was slain<a id="p45"><span class="pagenum">p45</span></a>
 In plaintive accents mildly queried <em>when?</em>
And all thine ancient prophets, sacred train,
 Looked for the perfect Guide and King of men.
<p>When wilt thou come to die as love divine,
 And on thy death raise thy eternal throne;
And in the glory of the Father reign,
 And bear the palm of victory alone?
<p>Forgive these queries, Lord, thou hast been born,
 And fought and won, and died and risen too;
And in thy rising, we behold the morn,
 The bright aurora of each victor true!

<h3>Part II. Section I.</h3>

<h3>Canto I.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Promised One came to this earth
 To walk as manhood ought to walk,
 And talk as manhood ought to talk,
And crown the excellence of birth.
<p>He came we know, but why came He?
 We do not know the wherefore all,—
 We fell, and constantly we fall,—
Life still hath its forbidden tree.
<p>He came the Father to obey,
 To seek and save that which was lost,
 To show that God at any cost
Would have us hope and live for aye.
<p>He freely came to live and die,<a id="p47"><span class="pagenum">p47</span></a>
 And rise again and conquer death;
 And breathe in man the living breath
Of godward life and purpose high.
<p>When did He come? When all the wise
 Expected that the hour was near,
 When God would speak to men more clear
Than he had done in ancient days.
<p>That a great prophet would arise,
 And all sweet harmony restore,
 As it should be and was of yore,
Ere sin made discords in the praise.
<p>When all the world expectant stood,
 And stillness reigned from sea to sea,
 As deep as that we feel when we
Pass through a lone and distant wood.
<p>When <span class="corrected" title="pophets">prophets</span> pure had ceased to be,<a id="p48"><span class="pagenum">p48</span></a>
 And all the Oracles were mute;
 And men thought more how to dispute
Than how to make men good and free.
<p>When after ample time, the race,
 Though wisely led by sages brave,
 Had wholly failed themselves to save,
But sinking deeper in disgrace.
<p>When fading fast was Grecian art,
 And Beauty fell to wicked lust,
 And Virtue wept as in the dust,
And vainer grew the human heart.
<p>When Rome was in her fullest swing,
 And her best orators in bloom,
 And when she wished for wider room,
And made the world her glory ring!
<p>While thus in splendor sparkled Rome,<a id="p49"><span class="pagenum">p49</span></a>
 As God responds to human need,
 As he performs what he decreed,
The Christ in Canaan made his home.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>And now His wondrous birth had been foretold,
As that of John, his great forerunner stern;
And thus was the foretelling of John’s birth:
<p>His father Zacharias was a priest,
A godly man but childless—a reproach.
He and his wife Elizabeth were old,
And stricken well in years. They had no hope
Of knowing what is true parental love,
But Zacharias had not ceased to pray.
<p>It came to pass while in his course as priest,<a id="p50"><span class="pagenum">p50</span></a>
While serving in the Temple of the Lord,
That unto him appeared an angel bright.
Perplexed was Zacharias and afraid,
But softly unto him the angel spoke:—
<p>“Fear not, thou chosen one, thy prayer is heard,
Thy wife Elizabeth shall bear a son,
And thou shalt name him John: Thou shalt have joy
And at his advent many shall rejoice;
For in the sight of God he shall be great.
<p>“And he shall neither taste strong drink nor wine;
And with the Holy Ghost shall he be filled,
Even from his mother’s womb. And he shall turn
A multitude of people to the Lord,
And go before him in Elijah’s power,
To make the fatherhood of man more true,
And disobedient children wise and just,
And to prepare a people for the Lord.”
<p>But Zacharias doubtfully replied:<a id="p51"><span class="pagenum">p51</span></a>
“Thy servant, heavenly messenger, is old,
My consort, also, well advanced in years;
Grant me a sign that this shall come to pass.”
<p>The angel answered more severe than soft:
“I am the angel Gabriel, that stands
In the celestial presence of the Lord,
And have been sent to speak to thee, and show
Thee these glad things. Lo! thou shalt be dumb,
And to speak not able, until the day
That these things be performed; because my words,
Which are potential, thou believest not.”
And in due season they were all fulfilled.
<p>The Christ’s nativity was thus foretold:
In six months after, the same messenger was sent
By Heaven unto a Galilean maid,
Who dwelt in Nazareth—a virgin fair,
Who was espoused to Joseph, David’s son;
And by the name of Mary she was known.
<p>The angel when he came accosted her:<a id="p52"><span class="pagenum">p52</span></a>
“Hail! thou art highly favored of the Lord,
And high above all women thou art blest.”
<p>The angel’s salutation troubled her,
And, as she pondered it, he further spoke:—
<p>“Fear not, for thou hast favor found with God:
Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son,
And <em>Jesus</em> thou shalt call his name. He shall
Be great, and called the Son of the Most High.
God shall give him his Father David’s throne;
And o’er the house of Jacob he shall reign;
And of his kingdom there shall be no end.”
<p>Then Mary to the angel meekly said:
“A virgin as I am, how shall this be?”
<p>The angel gently to direct her mind
Said: ”The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,
And the power of the Highest shade thee,
Therefore, that Holy Thing which shall be born
Of thee shall e’er be called the Son of God.
<p>“And lo! Elizabeth, thy childless cousin,<a id="p53"><span class="pagenum">p53</span></a>
She hath conceived a son in her old age;
And this with her six months ago occurred;
For nothing is impossible with God.”
<p>The Virgin full of faith and trust in God
Replied: “Behold the handmaid of the Lord;
Be it unto me according to thy word.”
The angel from her presence then withdrew.
<p>So reads the substance of the Sacred Text,
The very corner stone of Christian faith.

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>We turn to gaze upon His birth,
 And blending with simplicity
 We see the true sublimity,
And hear the heaven-ecstatic mirth.
<p>Believe the birth and all is clear,—<a id="p54"><span class="pagenum">p54</span></a>
 That of a Virgin, pure as morn,
 The Christ, both God and man, was born,
How natural then his works appear!
<p>This is the mystery of soul,
 Divine and human consciousness,
 The very God,—but man no less;
And yet one Being, Lord of all.
<p>Conception above human rhyme;
 The only real mystery
 Wrought by Supernal energy,
The crowning miracle of time.
<p>From such a birth alone could spring
 A life of such humility,
 A life of perfect sanctity
Of which the sacred muse did sing!
<p>The place was Bethlehem—place of fame,<a id="p55"><span class="pagenum">p55</span></a>
 For there once lived a poet terse,
 Who tuned his harp and played his verse,
And blessed the village with his name.
<p>The night was more than calm and clear;
 The moon and stars to fields of blue
 Had come as to a great review,
Their flocks the shepherds watched with care.
<p>A messenger from heaven above
 Descended in a stream of light,
 And towards the shepherds winged his flight,
And to them spoke these words of love:
<p>“Fear not, ye shepherds, for, behold,
 I bring glad tidings of great joy,
 Which shall the people’s minds employ,
As by the ancient prophets told.
<p>“For unto you is born this day,<a id="p56"><span class="pagenum">p56</span></a>
 Where David learned the inspired <span class="corrected" title="cord">chord</span>,
 A Saviour who is Christ the Lord,
And in a manger he doth lay.”
<p>And with the angel in a cloud
 Of glory floating in the air,
 Were multitudes of angels fair,
Who praised the Lord in accents loud.
<p>The music swelled from glen to glen:
 “All glory be to God on high,
 He reigns supreme through earth and sky,
Peace be on earth; good will to men.”
<p>And through the air there came again,
 As from the distance of the stars,
 The echo of the stirring bars,
“Peace be on earth; good will to men!”
<p>The rustic shepherds were amazed<a id="p57"><span class="pagenum">p57</span></a>
 At words of such sublimest sound;
 They felt they stood on holy ground,
As to the distant sky they gazed.
<p>Aroused by what the angel said
 And what they saw, the shepherds mild
 To Bethlehem went to see the Child,
Sustained by hope and awed by dread.
<p>The Babe they found; and word for word
 In accents soft they did unfold
 Their news till all their tale was told;
They knew the Child was Christ the Lord.
<p>And they who heard them wondered all;
 But Mary kept them in her heart,
 And ever pondered well each part
Of the report in her deep soul.
<p>Repeating often what they heard<a id="p58"><span class="pagenum">p58</span></a>
 And praising God for the event,
 Back to their sheep the shepherds went,
The Child they knew was Christ the Lord.
<p>And, as the shepherds, so shall we
 The Saviour find if try we will,
 And know that he is with us still,
And in good men his image see.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Each step we take through what hath been,
 We touch a Purpose broad as heaven
 By which we constantly are driven
To feel and grope for the Unseen.
<p>We witness revolutions strange,
 Old empires fall, new empires rise;
 But lo! the Purpose of the skies
Shines through them all without a change.
<p>Since the first beam of blessèd light,<a id="p59"><span class="pagenum">p59</span></a>
 The human heart longed to embrace
 Divinity among the race,
And know the Great Unknown aright!
<p>Imperfect were the lights of old,
 Imperfect were the virtues spun;
 But lo! in Christ the perfect sun
Are glories that can ne’er be told.
<p>In him all truths shine and accord,
 And in his presence we are dumb;
 He is the flower, the crown, the sum,
Of all perfections, Christ the Lord.
<p>When to the Temple He was brought,
 An infant on his mother’s breast,
 Clear faith beheld in him her rest
By holy inspiration wrought.
<p>Simeon held him in his arm,<a id="p60"><span class="pagenum">p60</span></a>
 He knew him as the Promised One,
 He knew him as the Light of men,
And in his heart he felt the charm
<p>And power that come alone by faith;
 And he rejoiced that he had seen,
 By heavenly intuition keen,
The Lord’s salvation in his death.
<p>Anna the prophetess at this
 Approached,—a holy soul was she,
 And there proclaimed her faith, that He
The Child was the Expected Bliss.
</div>

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Obscure once was the orb of day,
 A lonely beam in chaos old;
 So were the worlds that roll so bold
And flaming through the spacious sky.
<p>Obscure was earth at nameless date,<a id="p61"><span class="pagenum">p61</span></a>
 All things of time were once but small,
 But latent strength will after all
Make what is small the truly great.
<p>And lo! obscure the Saviour’s birth,
 Obscure in a terrestrial sense;
 Supernal greatness can dispense
With all vain-grandeur of the earth.
<p>We here behold the truly great,
 Great was the way Christ came to earth;
 Great was the melody and mirth,
Lo! here the greatness rides in state.
<p>O blame not Earth, she did the best
 That the conditions could afford,
 When as an infant Christ the Lord
Was gently laid upon her breast.
<p>Although the lights burned low and dim,<a id="p62"><span class="pagenum">p62</span></a>
 She sent to Bethlehem from afar
 The best of men, led by a star,
To welcome and to worship him.
<p>Should all the stars that grace the sky
 Be swept away by that day’s blast,
 And be forgotten in the past,
The wise men’s star shall never die!

<h4>VI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>All hail to the star of the East,
 All hail to the men that she led;
 The wisest were they, for they read
In the star the sign of the feast.
<p>All hail to the sons of the East,
 The kinsmen of Jethro and Job;
 God’s temple to them was the globe,
And the presence of God <span class="corrected" title="Inserted">was</span> their feast.
<p>Their journey was tedious and long,<a id="p63"><span class="pagenum">p63</span></a>
 They travelled by faith and by sight;
 And the star, the star of the Light,
Was ever their solace and song.
<p>True seekers of truth and of grace,
 True worshippers also were they;
 Their Saviour they sought far away
Where planets beam brightly in space.
<p>They came from the East like the morn,
 But guided they were by a star,
 A signal of peace, not of war,
The King of the Jews had been born.
<p>They studied the lore of the skies,
 They moved as the star moved above,
 The moved by the Spirit of love
In search of the King of the wise.
<p>They moved by the Spirit within,<a id="p64"><span class="pagenum">p64</span></a>
 They earnestly willed to embrace
 The Saviour, the truth, and the grace,
They sought full redemption from sin.
<p>All hail to the Saviour of men,
 The Light of the Gentiles is He;
 The captives ere long shall be free,
And Darkness must flee to his den!

<h4>VII.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>When by the <span class="corrected" title="city">city’s</span> busy gate,
 Jerusalem, as through the throng,
 They calm and solemn moved along,
They often did their mission state.
<p>“Pray, tell, where is He—we come from afar—
 Where is He that is born King of the Jews?
 That him we may worship, tell us the news,
For, lo! in the east we have seen his star.”
<p>As through the startled streets they moved,<a id="p65"><span class="pagenum">p65</span></a>
 The city, like an ocean free,
 Was troubled through and through to see
The wise in quest of whom they loved.
<p><span class="unclear" title="Bracketed: “Leave this out”">Astonished must have been the Jews
 To hear the mission of the men;
 So must have been the wise again
To know that it was such a news.</span>
<p>And lo! it seems so strangely odd,
 That ignorant of Jesus’ birth
 Then was the joy of the whole earth,
The City of the living God.
<p>The Magi must have felt the pause,
 As deeper their anxiety burned,
 But ah! their dream, ere they returned,
Might have explained to them the cause.
<p>Could they have read King Herod’s art,<a id="p66"><span class="pagenum">p66</span></a>
 Or understood his subtle mien,
 They might in Ignorance have seen
A Providence that knows the heart.
<p>Directed by the king were they,
 And by the proud Sanhedrin he,
 That Bethlehem still the place should be;
And knowing all they had to say,
<p>“Go,” said the king, “search, be not dim;
 For my thoughts with yours well accord;
 When you have found Him, bring me word
That I may come and worship him.”
<p>And “go” they did. To them appeared
 Again the star of perfect ray;
 And leading to the Child the way,
Stood o’er the place and brightly glared.
<p>Glad of the star, how short the road,<a id="p67"><span class="pagenum">p67</span></a>
 Of distance now they made no note,
 As only of the Child they thought,
And whom they worshipped as their God.—
<p>That God they sought in every <span class="corrected" title="cord">chord</span>
 Of Nature’s harmony sublime;
 And in the lights and shades of time,
They found at last in Christ the Lord.
<p>Lo! priests of Nature’s fane were they,
 But seekers for the Holy Place;
 The veil they lifted,—face to face
They saw the Lord himself that day.
<p>Earth in her choicest gifts was there,
 Her gold, her frankincense, and myrrh;
 And in the wise mankind, like her,
Gave homage due and treasures rare.
<p>Rejoice! man shall be made anew,—<a id="p68"><span class="pagenum">p68</span></a>
 Tribe after tribe, until the whole
 Be Christianized from pole to pole,
Then peace shall reign and justice too.

<h3>Canto II.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Earth’s record is of good and bad,
 Of the true God and Satan bold;
 And men, blind to the truth, have sold
The good for evil. This is sad.
<p>As lawlessness hates what is right,
 And as a truant hates the rod,
 And as a foolish man hates God,
So Darkness ever hates the Light.
<p>The good doth bruise the serpent’s head,
 The serpent too doth bruise its heel;
 This life is joy and pain we feel,
Eternal hope bedimmed by dread.
<p>Since the beginning this was so;<a id="p69"><span class="pagenum">p69</span></a>
 Man sold the good for evil then;
 And this repeats itself in men,
And some are worse than bad, we know.
<p>Such was king Herod—king no more!
 Incarnate cruelty was he,
 Unstable as a storm-lashed sea,
And hankering after human gore.
<p>By dream God slew his jealous aim,
 And sent the star-led Magi home
 On roads by which they did not come,
They knew not Herod’s will nor <span class="unclear" title="difficulty with handwriting">time</span>.
<p>By dream the Child in haste was sent
 To distant Egypt, there to stay
 Till Herod’s reign would wane away,
And his wrath be a past event.
<p>King Herod might have bruised His heel,<a id="p70"><span class="pagenum">p70</span></a>
 When he disturbed his childish rest;
 But Herod’s brutal power at best
Did only wound his earthly weal.
<p>Ye little ones! be bright and trim,
 For as a child Christ suffered pain;
 And Bethlehem’s children bear again
The palm of suffering for him.
<p>Ah! Herod’s wrath caused him to slay
 These flower-martyrs—infants dear!
 Their memories to Christ adhere
As flowers to spring and light to day.
<p>Unconscious they of any blame,
 Yet slain they were by cruel hand;
 Immortal are they as a band
Of martyrs young. They live in fame.

<div class="poem"><p>Men like the seasons come and go,
 And some are like the spring,—they strew
 In all their circles flowers new,
And fling around fresh life and glow.
<p>Some are like winter, men that blast
 Good will and hope and love, whose breath,
 Wherever they go, spreads plague and death;
And these they leave in wills at last.
<p>Men like the seasons come and go;
 They play their part in life and die;
 But Principles remain and try
Through other minds to work and grow.
<p>So Herod left the stage of life;
 And left upon Judea’s throne
 One of his sons, and he was prone
To stir the evil world to strife.
<p>When from the ancient Land of Corn,<a id="p72"><span class="pagenum">p72</span></a>
 God called his Son to Canaan fair,
 He warned fond Joseph not to rear
The Holy Child where he was born.
<p>So Nazareth His home he made,
 Among the hills a simple town,
 That would be yet without renown,
If Jesus there had never stayed.
<p>A proper place to nurse a bard,
 A prophet bold or a seer keen,
 Where the deep voice of the Unseen
In Nature’s anthems might be heard.
<p>Great is this favored hill-town’s fame,
 The feet of Christ the streets have trod;
 The narrow roads, the common sod
Are now as sacred as her name.
<p>Christ grew as other children grow,<a id="p73"><span class="pagenum">p73</span></a>
 He learned as other children learn;
 And as a child he had to earn
His real character below!
<p>He grew in knowledge of the truth,
 He grew in wisdom heavenly bright,
 And soon the consciousness of light
From God broke in upon his youth.
<p>The deep Divinity within
 Aroused him to his highest aim,
 He felt that God to him laid claim,
That He was sent to battle sin.
<p>And this at twelve as Scriptures tell:
 We wonder not that doctors wise
 Were stricken with profound surprise,
As in the law He reasoned well.
<p>His “Father’s business” was his theme,<a id="p74"><span class="pagenum">p74</span></a>
 The most sublime of any thought;
 His “Father’s business” in him wrought
Itself to be his thought supreme.
<p>Dare we say more? O dare we think
 That in the mind of One so young,
 Eternal consciousness had sprung
And therein stayed? From this we shrink.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Christ’s first recorded words are bold:
 “O wist ye not that I must be
 About my Father’s business?” He
Thus spoke when a child twelve years old.
<p>What child of twelve that ever spoke
 Such words of mighty weight as these,
 Such words that flow with such an ease
And carry such far-reaching stroke?
<p>The keynote of his teaching these,—<a id="p75"><span class="pagenum">p75</span></a>
 So worthy of the ripest sage,
 The central truth of every age,
Expound them any way you please.
<p>These words we have and only these,
 Till He came forth to Jordan’s bank,
 Where John proclaimed his message frank,
The message of eternal peace.
<p>Christ was obedient as a child,
 And men’s good will and grace He won;
 The “wist ye not” of her dear son
Clung to the Virgin’s bosom mild.
<p>In private life for eighteen years,
He learned to know our hopes and fears;
His daily bread He might have found
By toiling hard these years around!
<p>He might have gazed upon the sky<a id="p76"><span class="pagenum">p76</span></a>
 When stars bedecked the azure clear,
 And said: “By me these hosts appear,
 By me their lamps were lit on high.”
<p>When sun arose to run his race
 Through clouds of purple, gold, and red,
 He might have upward looked and said:
“By me that orb was hung in space.”
<p>But all is silence—all we know,
 As by the Scriptures we are taught,
 That of the Father’s will He thought,
And in God’s favor He did grow.
<p>So here we tread, as on the shore
 Of boundless truth, the Father’s will;
 Christ now prepared to fain fulfil
The will of God; and we should more.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4><a id="p77"><span class="pagenum">p77</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>The sympathy of God hath been
 So powerful with the world of men,
 That in the lines of every pen
That wrote its annals it is seen.
<p>By Him who reigns, men for the hours
 Step constantly upon the scene;
 The march of truth hath ever been
Triumphant against brutal powers.
<p>The truth divine from age to age
 Through glorious souls expressions find;
 And wholly vanquished leaves behind
All those who doth against it rage.
<p>The truth of Scripture is the same,
 Through it is moved from mould to mould;
 The New’s the essence of the Old,
And both are lit by the same flame.
<p>As truth evolves from stage to stage,<a id="p78"><span class="pagenum">p78</span></a>
 More brightly shine the stars of time;
 John, therefore, is the star sublime,
As he is next the Perfect Sage.
<p>The banks of Jordan echoed loud
 His ringing voice, whose accents stern
 Called to the Lord a quick return,
As wrath o’erhead hung like a cloud.
<p>Strange was his manner and his dress,
 And strange to us his meat and drink;
 Strange must have been his voice, we think,
And his new mission strange no less.
<p>A prophet of the desert he,
 A prophet from the desert too;
 His herald voice to Jordan drew
The multitudes to hear and see.
<p>John was a prophet bold and true,<a id="p79"><span class="pagenum">p79</span></a>
 And to repentance called the land;
 And by his powerful command
The people sought his doctrine new.
<p>They congregated at his cry,
 And were baptized in Jordan’s flood;
 And thus he cried: “Repent, do good,
For Heaven’s Kingdom draweth nigh.
<p>“Repent! repent! and flee from wrath,
 Believe in God and make life sweet;
 The graces in repentance meet,
And bearing fruit prove true your faith.
<p>“Return to God, seek life, not death,
 Be now baptized and save the soul,
 And give to God your powers all,
And live according to your faith.
<p>“Baptize I do with water pure,<a id="p80"><span class="pagenum">p80</span></a>
 But One is coming after me
 Who shall baptize most worthily—
And with the Holy Ghost and fire.”
<p>John like a tiller did prepare
 The soil for Christ the seed to sow;
 And as a herald he did go
To form the way and him declare.
</div>

<h3>Canto III.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Promised One now left his home,
 And never to return to stay;
 And towards the Jordan trod the way,
As many others there did roam.
<p>He went his history to make,<a id="p81"><span class="pagenum">p81</span></a>
 And to obey the herald’s call,
 And to perform his mission all,
Which did the realms of darkness shake.
<p>He had <span class="unclear" title="Handwriting says “unequal,” but that seems to have the wrong sense, doesn’t it?">an equal</span> record bright,
 Ere He the Son of Man became,
 A record of eternal fame,
The glory of the world of light.
<p>He made his record—which absorbs
 The words almighty “Let there be”—
 He made it in eternity
As into begin rolled these orbs.
<p>He made it in great majesty
 As on the <span class="unclear" title="difficulty with handwriting">verge</span> of chaos bound,
 He spoke those words, and at the sound
These worlds were built in harmony.
<p>The wordless eloquence of night,<a id="p82"><span class="pagenum">p82</span></a>
 As forth she turns her brilliant car,
 And the deep voice of every star,
Proclaim to us his record right.
<p>Each day that breaks whate’er it brings,
 Each storm that blows o’er land and sea,
 And heaven and earth and all that be—
Creation—all his record rings.
<p>And when we touch the mystery
 Of life in all its various forms,
 We feel that we are all but worms,
And wholly lost, O life, in thee.
<p>As on a blade or plant we gaze,
 Or lovely flower in the shade,
 We touch the power of Him who made
Life wonderful in every please.
<p>As we ascend along the line<a id="p83"><span class="pagenum">p83</span></a>
 From plant to brute and brute to man,
 Life in these spheres we cannot span,
What, then, of Him—the life divine!
<p>While scanning all these lands and seas,
 And this grand universe around,
 And listening to the quiet sound
Within, who shall from worship cease?
<p>Away with all unrighteousness!
 Shall we not give the Christ his due,
 When in the presence of such view
We witness his almightiness?
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>When Christ descended into this
 Terrestrial world as man to dwell,
 What He did leave no muse can tell,—
Who can describe the Heavenly bliss?
<p>Who can the life of God portray?<a id="p84"><span class="pagenum">p84</span></a>
 What do we know, in mind so dim,
 Of the true blessedness of Him
Who dwells in everlasting day?
<p>And in the thought we feel as lost,
 And in the thought we lose all pride,
 And humbly in His presence hide—
The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
<p>Communion above human thought,
 In absolute and blessèd one
 Between the Father and the Son,
By inward operations wrought.
<p>The true ideal perfect bliss,
 The absolute society
 Existing from eternity,
What blessed happiness is this!
<p>The Father’s bosom Jesus left<a id="p85"><span class="pagenum">p85</span></a>
 And its profound felicity,
 When He put on humanity
And dwelt in time as in a cleft.
<p>He laid aside the sov’reign crown
 That with the Father He had borne,
 A crown like an eternal morn,
And of unspeakable renown.
<p>He laid aside the sceptre bright,
 By which He ruled the glorious train
 Of angels in the heaven-domain
Of indescribable delight.
<p>Ah! Jesus left the sov’reign throne,
 That doth above all princedoms stand,
 The throne of absolute command,
That as the Son had been his own.
<p>He left all that the Son of God<a id="p86"><span class="pagenum">p86</span></a>
 Could leave, when He became as well
 The Son of Man. He bade farewell
To crown and throne and royal rod.
<p>Himself of no repute He made,
 Though rich He was, yet became poor;
 He did forgo his heavenly power,
And, as a man, lived in the shade.
<p>Lo! this is love and love divine,
 Eternal love, transcending ours;
 It knows no ebb, no bounds, no hours,
Such love, O Lord, alone is thine.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The gifts of God are like the dew
 In eastern skies that nightly fall,
 Or like the morn that crowns this ball
With floods of light and bounties new.
<p>They come like manna with each morn,<a id="p87"><span class="pagenum">p87</span></a>
 To gather them our daily work;
 Too oft from even this we shirk,
And in their midst we live forlorn.
<p>Life is a blessing, not a curse,
 And full of joy and peace and rest,
 By love divine and human blest,
With better future and not worse.
<p>Of all the gifts that God hath given
 This stricken earth from time to time,
 And many they, Christ is the prime,
He is the crowning gift of Heaven.
<p>God gave to man this world’s control,
 With all its seas and fertile ground;
 Of all these gifts that glow around,
The Christ is the best gift of all.
<p>Throughout all time the race He blest<a id="p88"><span class="pagenum">p88</span></a>
 With priests and prophets—leaders wise;
 But stars decline when suns arise,
Of all God’s gifts Christ is the best.
<p>We now the vital truth recall,
 Whate’er the future hath in store,
 And it is this; and shall grow more,
The Christ is the best gift of all.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>It is the law of Love to give,
 And sacrifice for others’ weal;
 Love is a principle, we feel,
That shall not die; its fruits shall live.
<p>And this is true of mine and thine,
 It ever pines to freely give,
 And lo! by giving it doth live,
And grow more like the love divine.
<p>Of love divine what shall we say?<a id="p89"><span class="pagenum">p89</span></a>
 Divine it is: Can we say more?
 We stand and look creation o’er,
We see the depth and feel the spray.
<p>When of the love supreme we think,
 All earthly things are less than small;
 For here we see God all in all,
And in infinitude we sink!
<p>Most blessèd theme and most sublime,
 Source of all goodness—love divine;
 It brightens all the orbs that shine
Before the Throne in space and time.
<p>It is the life of all the songs
 That make the <span class="corrected" title="ecstacy">ecstasy</span> of heaven;
 The living source of all gifts given
To myriads of angelic throngs.
<p>We kneel before thee, Love Divine,<a id="p90"><span class="pagenum">p90</span></a>
 As being in the Holy Place;
 And thee in Christ we do embrace,
For thou art Christ and Christ is thine.
<p>Christ is the gift of the divine,
 And love divine in him doth dwell;
 And of this love He came to tell,
That we may to this love incline.—
<p>That we may to this love incline,
 That we may of this love partake;
 And of this love our Saviour spake;
He is himself the love divine.
<p>Christ is the light, Christ is the love,
 Christ is the truth, Christ is the grace;
 And He is one of our own race,
He is the way to heaven above.
<p>As God in Christ to man is known<a id="p91"><span class="pagenum">p91</span></a>
 So man in Christ is known to God;
 Lo! God in Christ is understood,
And Christ knows really his own.
<p>Moved by his love, moved from within,
 He came as gentle as a dove,
 As winged by his eternal love,
To show the truth and die for sin.
<p>Not for his friends He came to die,
 Of finite love this is the most,
 He came for sinners that were lost
To sacrifice Himself for aye.

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>To thee, O gracious Lord, we sing,
 To thee in faith we pray;
And all our sins to thee we bring,

 We triumph by thy grace;
When shall we come to heaven above
 To see thee face to face?
<p>Teach us to sing the heavenly song,
 Though in the desert, Lord;
And by thy Spirit make us strong,
 And guide us by thy Word.
<p>When comes the time to fall asleep,
 Thou, Morning Star, we pray—
Conduct us safe across the deep
 In thine own blessèd way.

<h3>Part II. Section II.</h3><a id="p93"><span class="pagenum">p93</span></a>

<h3>Canto IV.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Of any life what do we know?
 Each life well spent is half concealed,
 Nay, less than half is e’er revealed,—
The roots before the tree must grow.
<p>Of the best lives what do we know?
 Half is concealed, nay, more and more;
 We see few waves upon the shore
And by them judge the depth below.
<p>We turn to John and hear a cry,
 A voice arising from the deep,
 A voice that did awake from sleep
A nation in the long gone by.
<p>And in the wilderness he cried:<a id="p94"><span class="pagenum">p94</span></a>
 “The highway of the Lord make straight.”
 And with the voice there spread such light
That into every heart it pried.
<p>And on the banks of Jordan’s flood
 The Lord himself appeared one day,
 And through the throng He made his way,
And praying by the Herald stood.
<p>Were I an artist I would paint
Two figures great—without restraint;
And John would be of stately grace,
And manhood beaming in his face;
His forehead broad and strong as Mars,
His eyes as deep and clear as stars;
And flowingly his locks he wore,
A prophet, he, and to the core.
<p>In the Christ’s features I would place
The best expressions of the race,
And in each feature—in each line,<a id="p95"><span class="pagenum">p95</span></a>
I would have blushing the divine;—
A perfect man—a perfect face,
The glory of the human race.
<p>O had the banks of Jordan known
 Who was to come to tread their sod,
 That Christ the Lord—the Son of God,
They would more velvety have grown.
<p>And as we view them standing there,
 The Herald and his Lord sublime,
 The greatest two that grace all time,
Their very presence charmed the air.
<p>And viewing them, as now we do,
 The Herald and his Blessèd Lord,
 We think the water of the ford,
As at the sight, slid slower through.
<p>To be baptized the Saviour came,<a id="p96"><span class="pagenum">p96</span></a>
 He needed not the cleansing rite,
 But there He stood as one contrite,
Who knew not sin nor any blame.
<p>The Herald knew his Lord and feared,
 He knew him by celestial ken,
 He knew him as the Light of men,
He felt his Lord had now appeared.
<p>The Prophet of the Jordan spoke:
 “Com’st thou to be baptized of me?
 I need to be baptized of thee;
Be thou the priest; grant me thy yoke.”
<p>Replied the Greater to the Less:
 “I came to be baptized of thee,
 And suffer now it so to be;
We should fulfil all righteousness.”
<p>The Saviour came not to destroy,<a id="p97"><span class="pagenum">p97</span></a>
 He came to honor and to bless;
 Obedience leads to righteousness,
And knowing God and endless joy.
<p>The Saviour came not to destroy,
 This all men knew and still know well;
 He came to show as well as tell
How we should act in his employ.
<p>The truths, that lit time’s ancient heights,
 Contain by him a worthier fee;
 As to fulfil the law came He,
He gave new lustre to old lights.
<p>John suffered him—John did obey,
 The law of God the prophet knew;
 For lights on lights and glories true
In meek obedience ever lie.
<p>As from the stream the Saviour came,<a id="p98"><span class="pagenum">p98</span></a>
 The heavens oped, and on him shone,
 Above the brightness of the sun,
From earth to heaven a holy flame.
<p>The Holy Spirit, as a dove,
 Descended in the splendor bright,
 And on the Saviour did alight,
A living charm of holy love.
<p>And from the sky above there fell
 The Father’s voice: “This is my Son,
 My only and belovèd one,
And I in him am pleasèd well.”
<p>John by obedience grew more strong
 In his belief, that Christ the Lord
 He had baptized in Jordan’s ford;
It added spirit to his song.
<p>As to the Godman, dare we say<a id="p99"><span class="pagenum">p99</span></a>
 That, by the Dove and spoken word,
 He felt more sure that He was Lord
Than He had felt before that day?
<p>O blest obedience! it doth bring
 Its own reward to you and me;
 It is indeed a fruitful tree
Wherein the birds of Eden sing.
<p>Obedience to the Word divine
 Brings rich contentment to the breast;
 The Dove of peace doth on it rest,
The light of God doth on it shine.
<p>Obedience wise! dispel our fear
 And fix our gaze on heaven above;
 Teach us to seek the land of love
And triumph over trials here.
<p>Rest, golden ladder, on our sod,<a id="p100"><span class="pagenum">p100</span></a>
 From rod to rod, from grace to grace,
 We all may climb till face to face
In glory we shall stand with God.

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Slanderer of God and man
 Around the Jordan lurked unseen,
 Whose mortal enmity had been
So deep against the Promised One.
<p>We trace the origin of him,
 And as in Holy Writ revealed,
 And, like his works, it is concealed,
Surrounded us by darkness dim.
<p>The origin of him implies
 The origin of evil too,
 A problem old and ever new,
So Satan is from earliest days.
<p>A spirit, he, of powers broad,<a id="p100"><span class="pagenum">p101</span></a>
 And superhuman, strong and keen,
 Who comes and goes at will unseen,
Created long ago by God.
<p>A subtle fallen angel, he,
 The leader of the throng accurst,
 Who did rebel and choose the worst
For nothing but for being free.
<p>When he did fall we do not know;
 He fell before mankind did fall;
 He is the fertile cause of all
Unrighteousness and wrathful woe.
<p>Where did he fall? We know he fell,
 And unredeemingly is lost;
 He fell and his rebellious host
As skies of stars from heaven to hell!
<p>As we through all the ages glance<a id="p102"><span class="pagenum">p102</span></a>
 We witness his demeanor vile,
 Assuming various names the while,
Whom we might call the God of chance.
<p>To him each age a name did weave,
 According to the form he bore,
 A serpent he was called of yore,
For by that brute he tempted Eve.
<p>And lo! among the sons of God
 He came and went, but bridled he;
 Then curbed the Demon seemed to be
By Him who wields the sov’reign rod.
<p>But, as more free to speed in space,
 He held with Michael high debate,
 With Michael the archangel great,
Concerning Moses’ burial place.
<p>About the time of Jesus’ birth<a id="p103"><span class="pagenum">p103</span></a>
 Known was his power and founded well;
 In Palestine the Prince of hell
Possessed men’s souls and claimed the earth.
<p>His enmity against the Son
Waxed furiously as time went on;
War was proclaimed in Eden’s shade,
When God the primal Promise made.
<p>In many struggles of renown
It seemed that Satan bore the crown;
And everlastingly he wrought
To quench the Light in human thought.
<p>But now the Christ had been declared,
The Son of God the Tempter feared,
He felt the direful combat nigh
When he would lose or win for aye.
The Tempter burned to strike the blow,
And the Messiah overthrow.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4><a id="p104"><span class="pagenum">p104</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>And now the Son of God began
 His task,—to suffer and to do,
 And to reveal Himself anew
Beneath the stars as the God-man.—
<p>Began his victories to win,
 Of which the hosts of heaven sing,
 The victories that richly bring
Complete salvation from all sin.
<p>He now began to fain undo
 The Devil’s work and build his own,
 And to lay down the corner stone
Of endless reputation true.
<p>He now began to win a crown
 Of glory—the Messiah’s claim;
 And this was his eternal aim
As He his precious life laid down.
<p>A crown outshining others far,<a id="p105"><span class="pagenum">p105</span></a>
 The “many crowns” which John did see,
 A crown of perfect brilliancy,
Each pearl of which shines like a star.
<p>A crown of living pearls, unknown
 On earth and only found in heaven;
 The crown that was to Jesus given
By God the Father as his own.
<p>The crown of glory and of grace,
 To this all other crowns are naught;
 The crown that the Messiah sought
When dying for the human race.
<p>Immortal crown beyond compare,
 A crown of universal reign,
 The crown the Father did ordain
That the victorious Christ should wear.
<p>He now began to win a throne<a id="p105"><span class="pagenum">p106</span></a>
 By being tempted and not sin,
 By suffering such pangs within,
Whose depths the Saviour knows alone.
<p>To win the throne of deathless praise,
 Whose splendor doth outshine the sun;
 That which was given the Promised One
When He ascended to the skies.
<p>He now began to know the fears
 Encircling man on every hand;
 And by experience understand
The deep philosophy of tears.
<p>He now began to feel the weight
 Of his great mission in his soul,
 The weight of bringing to us all
True immortality to light.

<h4>IV.</h4><a id="p107"><span class="pagenum">p107</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>For lo! the Son of God was led,—
 Led by the Spirit of the Lord,
 As He departed from the ford,
Into a dreary desert dread;
<p>By Satan to be tempted there,
 The virtueless, sin-hardened sprite,
 Who loves the wrong and hates the right
And breathes unqualified despair.
<p>God doth not tempt a soul to sin,
 And neither can He tempted be;
 But God Incarnate, as we see,
Was tempted painfully within.
<p>We wonder not that we are taught
 By Christ to pray, as for our bread,
 That we should not be ever led
To trial foul as He was brought.
<p>The Tempter’s subtlety He knows,<a id="p108"><span class="pagenum">p108</span></a>
 He felt the force of utmost test;
 The Son of God seemed at his best
To stand impeccably his blows.
<p>So strong, seductive, guileful too,
 And Satan-like was his attempt,
 And which would fell, if we exempt
The Saviour, any hero true.
<p>How mighty was the issue great!
 For in the balance hung as even
 The destiny of earth and heaven,
But Jesus kept his first estate.
<p>No fate of such momentous weight
 Was ever hung on one event,
 When shameless Wrong with full intent
Attempted to subvert the Right.
<p>High was the Tempter’s aim and fell,<a id="p109"><span class="pagenum">p109</span></a>
 And proud of Eden’s victory,
 He hoped to make—so daring he—
Of Christ the Lord a slave of hell!
<p>But Christ withstood the strong assault;
 <span class="noted" title="Replaces “Material strange the Tempter found / In Him—more solid and profound”">In Him at last the Tempter found
 Material strange,—more deep, more sound
Than he had met since his revolt.
<p>How real and how vain was this!
 How real Satan’s vain attempt,
 How real Jesus’ high contempt
When He the Tempter did dismiss.
<p>How real Christ’s experience is!
 More real than of any one;
 Lo! Christ is the Ideal Man
As on his throne He sits in bliss.

 He came victoriously at last,
The Light of men henceforth shall rise!
</div>

<h3>Canto V.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>To look at Him we come again:
 We glory in his victory
 And in the matchless dignity
With which He foiled the foe of men.
<p>When Christ by fasting long grew weak,<a id="p113"><span class="pagenum">p113</span></a>
 And gnawed by hunger’s sharpest tooth,
 The Tempter from his covert booth
Approached him and essayed to speak.
<p>The Saviour gazed and knew the foe,
 Though changed from his malignant mien;
 For through his Pharisaic sheen
Discernible were marks of woe.
<p>The Tempter feared,—he knew that eye,
 To him so terrible to behold;
 But falsely garbed, he, waxing bold
And trusting to succeed, did say:
<p>“The word hath reached this barren vast,
 That thou shalt wield a sov’reign rod,
 And that thou art the Son of God,
If thou art He break now thy fast.
<p>“For hunger’s pangs are keen and dread,<a id="p114"><span class="pagenum">p114</span></a>
 And cannot long be borne by thee;
 Be thine own stay if thou art He,
Command these stones to turn to bread.
<p>“By whom thou wert to this wild led
 I know not. Hope comes not to thee;
 Sustain thyself if thou art He,
Command these stones to turn to bread.
<p>“It is but right that life be fed;
 Exert thy power if thou art He,
 Protect the life entrusted thee,
Command these stones to turn to bread.”
<p>The Saviour thus made answer brief:
 “Lo! it is written and well known,
 Man doth not live by bread alone,
But by God’s will. He’ll send relief.”
<p>The foe tried Christ where He was frail,<a id="p115"><span class="pagenum">p115</span></a>
 Though sinless, He yet hunger knew,
 The hunger of prime manhood too,
By trusting God He did prevail.
<p>The Christ stooped not to selfish end
 To use his power—self-love is sin,
 Though strongly urged—urged from within,
Though tried in weakness by the fiend.
<p>He glorified his duty clear
 By trusting God though He should die;
 And lo! to those who watch and pray
The gracious angels do appear.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Tempter—Christ consenting—changed
 The scene of combat—half dismayed;
 Christ on the Temple’s spire he laid
As with one move of wing estranged.
<p>And judging him as other men,<a id="p116"><span class="pagenum">p116</span></a>
 That being human though divine,
 The human may to sin decline,
So he to Christ thus spoke again:
<p>“The Christ <span class="corrected" title="there">these</span> people long to see,
 Of whom the prophets spoke of old,
 The Son of God, therefore the bold,
Cast thyself down if thou art He.
<p>“They will require full signs of thee,
 In signs and wonders they believe;
 What better sign canst thou achieve?
Cast thyself down if thou art He.
<p>“Ere they shall put their trust in thee,
 Thou by a sign thy truth must prove,
 Forthwith all unbelief remove,
Cast thyself down if thou art He.
<p>“Declare thyself the Christ to be<a id="p117"><span class="pagenum">p117</span></a>
 By this descent and quell all fear;
 Pretenders constantly appear.
Cast thyself down if thou art He.
<p>“What hath the Son of God to fear?
 For it is written, as I see,
 The angels shall take charge of thee,
Cast thyself down,—thy help is near.
<p>“Trust in the promise given thee,
 Doubt not the promise of thy Lord;
 But trust in him, believe his word,
Cast thyself down if thou art He.”
<p>Christ to the demon thus replied
As He his vain desire denied:
<p>“As I am, Satan, not exempt
 From thy annoyance painful, hear
 Again that which is written clear:
‘The Lord thy God thou shalt not tempt.’&hairsp;”
<p>The Saviour shunned presumptuousness<a id="p118"><span class="pagenum">p118</span></a>
 And the persistent Tempter foiled;
 Within the bounds of law Christ toiled,
The law of love and righteousness.
<p>He exercised restraining power,
 And loved obedience more than fame;
 Unhurt He stood above all blame,
And in the midst of Satan’s fire.
<p>Presumptive man! tempt not thy Lord,
 But first of all do thou thy best;
 Divinity will do the rest,
Or rather will due aid afford.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>His field of action once again,
 The Tempter changed, and on the crown
 Of loftiest mount he set Him down,
And further tried the King of men.
<p>He caused to come before his sight<a id="p119"><span class="pagenum">p119</span></a>
 The mighty kingdoms of the earth,
 In all their regal pomp and worth,
Then Darkness thus spoke to the Light:
<p>“These are my realms that thou dost see,
 And they that <em>reign</em> are they that <em>live</em>;
 And all these things to thee I’ll give,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“These are my realms; by me kings reign;
 And what is life devoid of power;
 These kingdoms I will make thy dower,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“To reign man’s aim shall ever be,
 And over all thou shalt be king;
 All kingdoms shall thy glory <span class="unclear" title="Possibly “ring”">sing</span>,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“The truly great—all men like thee—<a id="p120"><span class="pagenum">p120</span></a>
 Have been, and should be, powerful kings;
 Thou shalt be heir of all these things,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“Of what avail shall be to thee
 All knowledge in this world of mine?
 Success and fame I will make thine,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“Of what avail shall be to thee
 All virtues though they are divine?
 These kingdoms shall be ever thine,
If thou wilt deign to worship me.
<p>“Conceding thou wert born to reign,
 Thy throne to gain how helpless thou;
 These kingdoms I will give thee now,
If thou to worship me will deign.”
<p>Thus Christ replied to Satan grim:<a id="p121"><span class="pagenum">p121</span></a>
 “Hence, Satan, hence! behold the word:
 ‘Thou shalt not worship but thy Lord,
Him shalt thou serve and only him!’&hairsp;”
<p>The Saviour stood, but Satan fell,
 Fell from the mount where stood the Just,
 Fell like a bolt to lowest dust,
Fell as he fell at first—to hell.
<p>So Satan fell, but dauntless he,
 He fell to rise in darkness dim;
 Another bruise awaited him,
Severer bruise on Calvary.
<p>So Satan fell as stricken sore,
 But soon resumed his woeful work
 Of tempting Christ from ambush dark,
And his disciples evermore.
<p>The Saviour stood as victor fair,<a id="p122"><span class="pagenum">p122</span></a>
 And as the Son of Man He stood;
 He stood as our Ideal Good,
He stood his nature to declare.
<p>The Saviour stood as victor true,
 And from the mount He soon espied
 The firmament being glorified,
As hosts of angels nearer drew.
<p>They ministered to Jesus’ need
 Such aid as only angels can;
 And strengthened thus, the Son of Man
Began his public life indeed.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>To Christ we look for sympathy,
 Encouragement, and succor staid;
 And by his sympathy and aid
We hope to win the victory.
<p>In all points tempted in man’s guise,<a id="p123"><span class="pagenum">p123</span></a>
 And yet without being stained by sin;
 And lo! in all the points <span class="corrected" title="therein">wherein</span>
Christ suffered He can sympathize.
<p>And knowing suffering as He
 Experienced here, He doth extend
 To us who frequently offend
His sympathetic succor free.
<p>And he who suffers also grows
 More sympathetic with the race;
 It is a quality of grace
That Jesus truly only knows.
<p>Unsoiled by sin in any wise,
 Untouched by changes insecure,
 The sympathy of Christ is pure,
And <span class="noted" title="[sic]">stedfast</span> as the heavenly skies.
<p>And at the thought we feel opprest,<a id="p124"><span class="pagenum">p124</span></a>
 And at the thought we wonder much,
 That Jesus Christ can be in touch
Today with every human breast.
<p>And like Himself his sympathy
 Is ever present—ever near,
 To strengthen faith and subdue fear,
And help us on to victory.

<h3>Part III. Section I.</h3>

<h3>Canto I.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Saviour by his life and death
 Himself perfected as our king;
 And from his life the muse would bring
Few touching facts to nourish faith.
<p>Deep is the life of any soul,
 And deeper far than deepest thought;
 But lo! the life that Jesus wrought
Is the profoundest life of all.
<p>And by the sparse recorded facts<a id="p126"><span class="pagenum">p126</span></a>
 We know his life as here He dwelt,
 The life of Him who taught and felt,
Who threw his character into acts.
<p>He went about performing good,
 But yet his Godhead He concealed;
 At first it was but half revealed,
And very slightly understood.
<p>He seemed reluctant to unfold
 His heavenly origin to men;
 Though closely guarded, now and then
It sparkled through the human mould;
<p>It sparkled through the human cloud
 That shrouded his Divinity;
 And in the quick rapidity
Wherewith He vanished from the crowd;
<p>It sparkled in his deeds of power,<a id="p127"><span class="pagenum">p127</span></a>
 And in his thoughts divinely rich,
 And in the fortitude <span class="corrected" title="in">with</span> which
He calmly met his latest hour!
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>And as we touch the life supreme—
 The sweetest harp—the life of Christ,
 O may the muse-evangelist
Be kindled by the heavenly theme!
<p>As from his test returned the Lord
 And intermingled with the throng,
 That by the Jordan wound along,
The Herald struck the living <span class="corrected" title="cord">chord</span>:
<p>“Behold the Lamb of God,” he cried.
 The breeze embraced the joyful sound
 And all the vocal hills around
“Behold the Lamb of God” replied.
<p>The Lamb of God which takes away<a id="p128"><span class="pagenum">p128</span></a>
 The sin of those who in him trust,
 The Lamb appointed ere the dust
Of time was weighed and night knew day.
<p>“Behold the Lamb of God,” he cried.
 Around the echo loitered long
 While at the Saviour gazed the throng,
And many hearts on him relied.
<p>The Herald’s voice doth still resound
 From land to land, from shore to shore,
 And will, till time shall be no more,
And the lost sheep of God be found.
<p>The spotless Lamb whom Mercy chose,
 Divine Humanity is He;
 He died for our iniquity,
And in his merits we repose.
<p>The perfect Lamb whose blood was shed<a id="p129"><span class="pagenum">p129</span></a>
 Amid the gloom on Calvary;
 Whereby we see Humanity
Arising to its fountain-head.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Unselfish Herald of the Christ,
 His brilliant star was setting fast;
 The Light of God and men at last
Beamed forth in glory through the mist.
<p>And bearing now the Herald’s seal,
 Few of true faith to him did cling;
 They found in him the Christ–their King,
They followed him through woe and weal.
<p>Men dropped their calling at his call,
 And brooked by faith the future dark;
 The fishermen forsook their bark,
And gave to him their lives—their all.
<p>All worldly prospects, wealth, and name,<a id="p130"><span class="pagenum">p130</span></a>
 At Jesus’ feet they fain did place;
 An hour beneath his radiant face
Was more to them than wealth and fame.
<p>True hope spring in each honest breast,
 Indefinite, yet hope serene;
 And nourished by his teaching keen,
Became the hope of blessèd rest.
<p>O what a privilege had they
 Who followed here his righteous feet;
 And held with him communion sweet
Beneath the radiance of his eye!
<p>The eye that made the maniacs mild,
 And struck the demons bold with awe,
 And wept in pity o’er our woe,
And cheered the bosom of a child!
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4><a id="p131"><span class="pagenum">p131</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>In Cana dawned the wedding hour,
 The home of peace and festive joy;
 There the Messiah did employ
First his high miraculous power.
<p>Not in the seat of learning where
 For ages clustered all the wise;
 Ah! Prejudice had dimmed the eyes
Of those who sat in judgment there.
<p>But lo! in Cana He put forth
 His power supreme in mighty deed,
 Among the friends who knew their need,
Who valued well his sterling worth.
<p>Some <span class="unclear" title="difficulty with handwriting">truest</span> twain by love tried long
 Had been made one by golden tie,
 Made one in will and heart for aye,
And merry was the marriage song.
<p>The wine did cease, but Christ was there,<a id="p132"><span class="pagenum">p132</span></a>
 The good fails not when present He,
 His is the fruit of every tree
And vine throughout creation fair.
<p>“Fill ye the waterpots,” He said,
 The water <span class="noted" title="Replaces “felt the touch”">heard the voice</span> divine,
 And lo! it sparkled into wine
Of choicest taste and rarest red.
<p>The gentle <span class="noted" title="Replaces “touch”">voice</span> of Christ divine
 Turns darkness into brightest day,
 And mourning into joyful lay,—
The bitter cups of life to wine.
</div>

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The worldly spirit of those days,
 Disdaining every sacred <span class="noted" title="[sic]">cord</span>,
 Had turned the Temple of the Lord
Into a house of merchandise.
<p>Each feast was but a market day,<a id="p133"><span class="pagenum">p133</span></a>
 The Temple but a market place;
 The tempting shekel was the grace
For which too many there did pray.
<p>His “Father’s house”—the house of prayer,
 Thus to a “den of thieves” was turned;
 And seeing this, the Saviour burned
With holy zeal at such a fair.
<p>Asserting then his Sonship proud,
 As by the force of filial love,
 The money-changers out He drove
Without a murmur from the crowd.
<p>The oxen went as they were driven,
 The timorous sheep without being led;
 Each harmless lamb, with back-turned head,
Walked out before the Prince of heaven.
<p>The oxen questioned not his right,<a id="p133"><span class="pagenum">p134</span></a>
 His majesty the creatures knew;
 The traders from his presence flew,
Not daring to provoke his might.
<p>But rulers of a selfish mind
 Soon doubted his authority;
 What blindness like the bigotry
Of those who see and yet are blind!
</div>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>When sown by word or wondrous sign,
 Truth never fails to find good ground;
 And as pure grain, it doth abound
In golden harvest. Truth divine
<p>By native force strikes through the soul,
 And strongly works conviction there;
 And, conquering, it leaves a glare
Of wisdom through the powers all.
<p>So Nicodemus, ruler rare,<a id="p135"><span class="pagenum">p135</span></a>
 Believed Christ’s works divinely wrought;
 But wishing to conceal the thought
To him by night he did repair.
<p>Christ took his theme—the birth anew,
 The nature by the Spirit given,
 Whereby man realizes Heaven
On earth in his experience true.
<p>The consciousness of spiritual strife
 Is a development within,
 By which the tendency to sin
Is conquered by the holy life.
<p>“Man must be born again,” He said—
 Be born of God—born from above—
 Born to a life of growth in love
Of which Messiah is the head.
<p>And by the love of God we soar<a id="p136"><span class="pagenum">p136</span></a>
 Above the troubles of this ball;
 And by his love, despite the fall,
We live in Christ forevermore.
</div>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The greatest truths that tongue can tell,
 While resting in the cool retreat
 With aching limbs and weary feet,
The Saviour spoke by Jacob’s well.
<p>“God is <em>the</em> Spirit,” muttered He.
 And not confined to any place;
 But present he throughout all space,
Invisible, eternal, free!
<p>Earth is made sacred by the breast
 That worships God in truth aright;
 Man is the temple where the Light
Ineffable delights to rest.
<p>Ah! greater than all works of art<a id="p137"><span class="pagenum">p137</span></a>
 And temples of imposing size,
 Is the deep spirit of the wise,
The piety of the human heart.
<p>Another truth He uttered there;
 “And I that speak to thee am He”—
 The Christ that was to come and be;
First there Himself He did declare.
<p>Not to the learned of the fold,
 Not to the <span class="corrected" title="pround">proud</span> self-righteous host;
 But to a woman that was lost
First his Messiahship He told.
<p>Though soiled by sin, how apt was she,
 When taught by Jesus, to embrace
 The highest truths of saving grace,
And the divine Messiah see.
<p>The women of Samaria found<a id="p138"><span class="pagenum">p138</span></a>
 The world’s Redeemer—found the Christ,
 And like a true evangelist,
She went announcing him around.
<p>Thrice blessèd Sychar—crowned with grace,
 Where Jesus had reception sweet,
 And two days’ rest for weary feet
While wandering here from place to place.
</div>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Who hath the fancy to describe
 The wonders of the Nazarene,
 As He, with countenance serene,
Healed all the sick of every tribe?
<p>And as He walked through Galilee,
 Diseases fled from all the land;
 For by the waving of his hand
He set the sick-bound captives free.
<p>Capernaum knew his mighty sway;<a id="p139"><span class="pagenum">p139</span></a>
 The son of one of untold wealth
 He there restored to perfect health
From Cana—twenty miles away.
<p>At will, by simple touch or word,
 He made the sick and dying well;
 Each miracle was like a bell
Declaring him to be the Lord.
<p>And thus aroused the sick and lame,
 The palsied and the tortured soul,
 All came to him and were made whole,
New life pulsated through each frame.
<p>The minds that were but discords rude,
 All self-control and reason lost,
 The slaves of Satan and his host,
The Christ restored to sweetest mood.
<p>The demons trembled at his sight,<a id="p140"><span class="pagenum">p140</span></a>
 For stay of wrath they cried aloud;
 But Christ dislodged the hostile crowd
As day dislodges darkest night.
<p>The born-blind eyes He made to see,
 And that foul death—the leprosy,
 At his mere touch and mastery,
Relaxed its hold and ceased to be.
<p>He gave the deaf the power to hear,
 The dumb heard him and lo! they spoke,
 And at his voice the dead awoke
And were restored to bosoms dear.
</div>

<h4>IX.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>These signs and wonders stirred the heart
 Of Jewry and of Galilee,
 And Tyre and Sidon by the sea;
His mighty deeds moved every part.
<p>The people were not slow to see<a id="p141"><span class="pagenum">p141</span></a>
 A superhuman power in him;
 The honest minds were not so dim
As not to know Divinity.
<p>They flocked to hear his words of grace
 As from his sacred lips they fell;
 Each word bore its peculiar spell,
As in each heart it found a place.
<p>What oratory rare was his!
 What easy flow of eloquence
 That moved in cadence with the sense,
For all was nature crowned with bliss!
<p>Could we have heard his <span class="noted" title="Replaces “vivid”">gentle</span> voice
 In Synagogue, on mountain free,
 Or by the Lake of Galilee,
How would our longing hearts rejoice!
<p>Could we have seen his Godlike mien,<a id="p142"><span class="pagenum">p142</span></a>
 So heavenly meek, so sweetly stern,
 Then in His presence we would learn
Not what man is, but might have been.
<p>Attracted by his works divine,
 His people all in full accord
 Heard from his lips the living word,
As thirsty ground receives the rain.
<p>Fatigued by working for the race,
 In shady nook, on mountain peak,
 He oft in solitude did seek
The favor of his Father’s face.
<p>Descending Hattin’s verdant slope,
 And meeting his disciples there,
 He gave them in the open air
The Oracles of Life and Hope:
<p>Oh, blessèd they who know their need,<a id="p143"><span class="pagenum">p143</span></a>
 Who are self-conscious of their sin—
 Of their deep poverty within,
For they with God shall reign indeed.
<p>Oh, blessèd they of mournful mind,
 Who seek in tears what they have lost,
 Who sorrow for themselves the most,
For they shall sweetest solace find.
<p>Oh, blessèd are the truly meek,
 Who try to honor only worth;
 For lo! they shall possess the earth,
And grow in grace from week to week.
<p>Oh, blessèd they who ever yearn
 And hunger after righteousness,
 Who seek the highest happiness,
For they the great reward shall earn.
<p>Oh, blessèd they who mercy know,<a id="p144"><span class="pagenum">p144</span></a>
 Who love their foes and do forgive;
 The merciful shall ever live,
They shall obtain what they bestow.
<p>Oh, blessèd are the pure in heart
 Whose wills, like springs, are clear and bright,
 Who live by faith and love the light,
They shall see God and not in part.
<p>Oh, blessèd are the peaceful ones,
 Who ever treat the righteous road;
 For they shall be the heirs of God,
And shine in glory like the suns!

<h3>Canto II.</h3><a id="p145"><span class="pagenum">p145</span></a>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Hail! Holy Land, thy name we greet,
 Thy fame and consecrated soil;
 Thou dost remind us of the toil
Of Him who made our <span class="noted" title="Replaces “future”">lives so</span> sweet.
<p>Thy lofty mounts and mellow meads,
 Thy purling brooks and restless sea,
 All Jewry and all Galilee
Reminds us of his wondrous deeds.
<p>Today around thy mountain-domes
 Traditions linger like the clouds;
 For there the Christ fed fainting crowds,
Ere He dismissed them to their homes.
<p>With lifted hand and solemn mien,<a id="p146"><span class="pagenum">p146</span></a>
 Oft on the grassy desert slope,
 He showed to multitudes the hope
That springs from knowing the Unseen.
<p>Approaching was the evening hour,
 And knowing hunger’s pangs as He,
 The multitude in sympathy
He fed by his miraculous power.
<p>The scant supplies the Christ did bless,
 And broke and gave—exhaustless they.
 They in his hands did multiply,
He gave, but they grew nothing less.
<p>Five loaves, two fishes—what were these
 <span class="noted" title="[sic]; surely should be “Among”">Betwixt</span> so many? By his will
 They might have fed more numbers still,
As many as the Christ did please.
<p>“Waste not the fragments,” said the Lord;<a id="p147"><span class="pagenum">p147</span></a>
 And what remained of the repast
 Was fondly gathered all at last,
Twelve baskets full was the reward.
<p>To those who sought the lessons given
 He also gave sustaining food;
 To those desirous to be good
He taught the principles of Heaven.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Tiberias! restless, wilful sea,
 Unruly, passionate, and wild;
 And yet at times so tame and mild
And quiet as a sea can be.
<p>Gennesareth! thou seem’st to be
 Beneath the brows of mountains high,
 As up thou lookest to the sky,
The dark blue eye of Galilee.
<p>The slightest gales disturb thy rest;<a id="p148"><span class="pagenum">p148</span></a>
 Too apt thou art to rise and roar,
 And dash thyself against the shore,
As if deep anger swelled thy breast.
<p>Did any one thy wrath restrain,
 And calm thee when the winds did rise?
 Ah! none but He who made the skies,
And set thy bounds, O mighty main!
<p>Ah! none but He—the Nazarene,
 He calmed thy waves when tempest-tost,
 When thou didst rise and rage the most,
And made thee like a saint serene.
<p>No will but his thou didst obey,
 No voice but his thou e’er didst know,
 The will and voice that led thy flow
To where thou rollest to this day.
<p>Great kings and emperors have stood<a id="p149"><span class="pagenum">p149</span></a>
 Upon thy shores from age to age;
 But thou didst not restrain thy rage,
Nor when they sailed thy tossing flood.
<p>Thou heedest not the sailor’s sigh,
 The crying of the shipwrecked crew;
 To all—to Gentile and to Jew
Thou art the self-same sea for aye.
<p>But lo! the Christ—the Man Divine,
 Him thou didst know and know of old—
 Know since thy water sweetly rolled
At his command to be a main.
<p>O didst thou feel within the breast,
 Whenever He stepped upon thy shore,
 An inclination to adore,
And from thy shore retreat and rest?
<p>When from a ship close to thy shore<a id="p150"><span class="pagenum">p150</span></a>
 The living truths He did impart,
 O didst thou feel in thy deep heart
A calm thou didst not know before?
<p>When to and fro He sailed on thee,
 Conducting all from woe to weal,
 O didst thou then, Tiberias, feel
More honored far than any sea?
<p>Roll on, O Sea, as doth thy name,
 Though time hath changed thy scenes around,
 Though towns have crumbled to the ground,
Thou, as thy Master, art the same.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>Before we leave Tiberias’ strand,
 And in these songs bid it adieu,
 We turn two incidents to view,
Dramatic, supernatural, grand!
<p>While the Disciples hoisted sail,<a id="p151"><span class="pagenum">p151</span></a>
 The Shepherd of the scattered sheep—
 The Saviour soon fell fast asleep,
Worn by the day’s laborious toil.
<p>The sun beyond the hills had set,
 Unrippled was the sea and bright,
 As twilight darkened into night,
No sign of storm approached as yet.
<p>The cities vanished in the dark,
 The tumult from the shore did cease;
 And softly blew the scented breeze
As <span class="corrected" title="sea-ward">seaward</span> lightly sailed the bark.
<p>The night bedecked with stars the sky,
 And wore the moon upon her breast,
 While He in sleep found needed rest;
No sign of tempest yet was nigh.
<p>“The gentle breeze, the plying oar,”<a id="p152"><span class="pagenum">p152</span></a>
 Said the Disciples, “ere we know,
 If this fair night continue so,
Will set us on the other shore.”
<p>But suddenly the moon turned pale,
 The stars enwrapped themselves in gloom
 As they announced the coming doom,
And from the mountains blew the gale!
<p>And at the signal of the blast,
 The sea began to roar and rise,
 And darkest clouds swept through the skies,
Till clouds and waves touched fronts at last!
<p>And up and down the ship was tossed
 Though skilful seamen with her wrought;
 Ah! bravely with the storm they fought,
But every surge pronounced them lost!
<p>Then like dread demons from the cloud<a id="p153"><span class="pagenum">p153</span></a>
 The blazing, forkèd lightnings flashed,
 And thunder upon thunder crashed,
And loudest roarings grew more loud!
<p>The sea was but confession deep
 As into utter madness hurled,
 As if wild chaos ruled the world;
And yet the Christ was sound asleep!
<p>Experienced as they were and brave,
 The beaten boat was knocked about
 So ruthlessly—they had no doubt
That they would perish in the wave!
<p>They thought of Him who was asleep:
 “How worn and weary He must be;”
 And of themselves they thought—“Could He
Now save <span class="corrected" title="them">us</span> from the maddened deep?”
<p>“Awake the Master,” some one said,
 “Awake the Master.”—At the word
 They cried: “We perish, save us, Lord!”
He woke, He rose, and answer made:
<p>“Doubt not! believe! Why did ye fear?
 Ye winds and surges, peace, be still!”
 The storm fell dead before His will,
The sea fell calm, the sky shone clear!
<p>Roll on, O Sea, His power proclaim,
 Though time hath changed thy scenes around,
 Though towns have crumbled to the ground,
To rise and roar is still thy aim.

<h4>IV.</h4><a id="p155"><span class="pagenum">p155</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>As evening set the shades afloat,
 The Saviour, with a weary look,
 Retired, it seemed, to mountain nook,
But sent the Twelve home by a boat.
<p>Departing from the multitude,
 For by them He was sorely pressed,
 He climbed the mountain as in quest
Of perfect rest in solitude.
<p>The Twelve embarked, the night was gay,
 From wave to wave the ship did float
 As smoothly as from note to note,
Repose and calm breathed in the sky.
<p>But unexpectedly a change
 Stole over sky, wind, sea, and shore;
 They knew the passage well of yore,
But not so rough as now—so strange.
<p>As by a cruel whirlwind caught,<a id="p156"><span class="pagenum">p156</span></a>
 Long on the sea were they delayed;
 So long that they were half dismayed,
But still the storm they stoutly fought.
<p>They <span class="noted" title="[sic]; surely should be “reefed”">tacked</span> the sail and plied the oar,
 Nor very far they had to go,—
 Four or five miles, or somewhat so,
But yet they failed to reach the shore.
<p>They seemed to be held clear mid way,
 As by a strange mysterious fate
 From early eve till very late,
Though toiling in the blast and spray.
<p>But lo! approaching through the storm,
 And walking on the crested tide,
 Light as a shadow, they espied,
Or thought they did, a human form.
<p>Bestirred by fear they gazed and gazed,<a id="p157"><span class="pagenum">p157</span></a>
 But nearer through the mist and spray
 Came the strange form—“A spirit,” cried they,
As troubled as they were amazed!
<p>And still He walked and to them drew,
 As if the deep were solid ground;
 They cried for fear!—In sweetest sound
These friendly words to them He threw:
<p>“Hail! it is I; be of good cheer.”
 Then Peter said: “O Lord, bid me
 If it be thou to come to thee.”
“Come,” said the Christ, “and do not fear.”
<p>He walked the sea as he did list,
 Firm as his faith, firm as his Lord;
 His feet and faith did well accord,
He walked while he saw only Christ.
<p>But when he saw the wind and sea,<a id="p158"><span class="pagenum">p158</span></a>
 His faith on Christ lost her strong hold;
 He like his faith became less bold;
His faith soon sank and so did he.
<p>“Lord, save me,” Peter cried aloud!
 “Why is thy faith so weak and dim?”
 The Saviour said, as He raised him,
And held him dripping like a cloud.
Christ gently helped him to the boat,
 The Peter who was ever brave,
 Whom He delighted well to save,
And train to strike faith’s highest note!
<p>Winds ceased to blow and waves to brim.
 As from the storm thus they were freed,
 The Twelve exclaimed: “Thou art indeed
The Son of God.” They worshipped him.
<p>Methinks the surges whispered soft,<a id="p159"><span class="pagenum">p159</span></a>
 As He stepped lightly on their breast:
 “Divinity touchèd now our crest,
As o’er the main He <span class="corrected" title="walkèd">walked</span> aloft.”
<p>Roll on, thou Sea, proclaim the praise
 To generations yet unborn;
 Proclaim it till the latest morn;
Then thou wilt cease to roar and rise.
</div>

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>As Christ would now his death declare,
 Of his Disciples He took three
 To some high mount apart, to see
As much of Heaven as they could bear.
<p>What mount it was we do not know;
 We may conjecture, and were we
 To mention any, it would be
Mount Hermon with its crowns of snow.
<p>Christ had his friends—his chosen three,<a id="p160"><span class="pagenum">p160</span></a>
 And those they were who knew him best;
 Whose sympathy relieved his breast,
For understood He longed to be!
<p>He chose the Twelve and from them three,—
 The inmost circle of the heart,
 So formed by birth and grace; apart
Therein the Saviour was most free.
<p>His deep affinity we meet
 Oft in the sphere of mind and grace;
 As Christ was man, it lit his face,
And made the cross of life more sweet.
<p>Who were these three—these blessèd three?
 The rock-like Peter—he was one,
 The Sons of Thunder—James and John,
Lo! John, the most beloved was he.
<p>Night winged her shades as up they trod,<a id="p161"><span class="pagenum">p161</span></a>
 The Saviour and his chosen three,
 Up Hermon’s dewy peaks may be,
To be with Nature and with God.
<p>Still was the night and calm the sea,
 And clear as sanctity the sky;
 And up the mount they wandered high,
Communing with Eternity.
<p>And through each floating, fleecy cloud,
 The stars beamed forth in sacred glow;
 That lofty solitude was so
That Silence almost spoke aloud.
<p>On that secluded, sublime height,
 Engaged in a sublimer prayer,
 While they—the three—half slumbered there,
Around the Saviour glared a light.
<p>His face beamed as the radiant sun,<a id="p162"><span class="pagenum">p162</span></a>
 His garments shone as white as snow,
 As the Divine did overflow
The earthly in the Blessèd One.
<p>And shaded by a cloud unique,
 Elijah, Moses—heirs of light,
 Appeared in glory heavenly bright,
And of his <em>death</em> to him did speak.
<p>When Peter saw the vision fair,
 He spoke, enraptured by the spell,
 And while he spoke from the cloud fell
A voice, like music, through the air,
<p>The voice of the Eternal Throne:
 “This is my Son beloved, him hear.”
 The vision then did disappear,
And to the three Christ came alone.
</div>

<h3>Part III. Section II.</h3><a id="p163"><span class="pagenum">p163</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>“Be not afraid,” said He, “arise.”
 As down the mountain they did go
 To mix again with life below,
The morning purpled all the skies.

<h3>Canto III.</h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The conqueror of death is He,
 For this high mission He was born;
 And in death’s chamber—dismal urn,
He lit the lamp of life to be.
<p>Three times He met the fatal foe,
 Three times He won the glorious strife,
 Three times He called the dead to life,
As He passed through this world of woe.
<p>Ah! Jairus wept whelmed by despair,
 His daughter <span class="corrected" title="laid">lay</span> in death’s embrace;
 But Jesus made the soul retrace
Its flight and animate the fair.
<p>The second was the widow’s son,
 Her only son, maybe her stay;
 As dust to dust they did convey,
Who met them but the Promised One?
<p>As to the grave the dead was borne
 They met the Lord of life mid way,
 And lo! that cold and lifeless clay
Beheld a resurrection morn.
<p>Touched by the mother’s grief and pain,
 The Christ, who knows a mother’s heart,
 Could not but utmost aid impart,
Restored her son to life again.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4><a id="p165"><span class="pagenum">p165</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>To Bethany we now repair,
 As often did the Light of men,
 To seek the fire of song again,
On that warm hearth He brightened there.
<p>The happy hearth made still more sweet
 By Him who found a vacant chair,
 Come when He would, awaiting there,
And ready hands and willing feet.
<p>The home of Lazarus—the host,
 Of Mary, Martha, sisters dear,
 The home of faith and practice clear,
And, as it seems, of Christ almost.
<p>At least it was his fond retreat,
 His oasis in the wilderness,
 When with his presence He did bless
Judea and the Temple meet.
<p>Ah! there He found refreshing rest,<a id="p166"><span class="pagenum">p166</span></a>
 And whiled away the dreary night,
 As one of that warm circle bright,
He was their honored blessèd guest.
<p>’Twixt parting day and coming night,
 Worn by the labors of the day,
 He oft returned to them to stay
Till dewy morn again shone bright.
<p>The cavil of hypocrisy,
 The bigotry of scribe and priest,
 Who claimed the most and knew the least,
Touched not the home in Bethany.
<p>For once inside that cottage door,
 The cry of opposition ceased;
 Time after time the Christ was pleased
To see the shadows on that floor.
<p>Through Kedron’s vale He oft did go,<a id="p167"><span class="pagenum">p167</span></a>
 And o’er the brow of Olivet,
 As from Hypocrisy’s deep threat,
To balmy Bethany below.
<p>Judea witnessed many signs
 Wrought by the Lord, but Prejudice
 Continued still to blind the eyes
Of those self-seeking, shrewd divines.
<p>The born-blind man walked to and fro;
 That he could see was now well known;
 But blindest malice would not own
The Promised One who made him so.
<p>That He was the expected Christ
 In yonder Temple He had taught;
 What mortal hatred this had wrought
Is told by each Evangelist.
<p>While roaming from this anger dread,<a id="p168"><span class="pagenum">p168</span></a>
 And knowing what would happen too,
 Though called He stayed, and though He knew
That Lazarus indeed was dead.
<p>Yes, dead he was and in the grave,
 And dissolution had set in;
 Three days at least He <span class="corrected" title="laid">lay</span> within
The sepulchre—that limestone cave.
<p>When Christ came to the scene of death,
 “Hadst thou been here,” each sister said,
 “My brother, Lord, would not be dead,”
Exhibiting in him their faith.
<p>As Christ was nigh by a full cry
 And tears they eased their hearts of grief.
 They looked to him for some relief,
Deploring much his long delay.
<p><span class="corrected" title="No quotation marks in original">“Where have ye laid him?” queried He—<a id="p169"><span class="pagenum">p169</span></a>
 The Resurrection and the Life—
 The Christ who knows the keenest strife,
And thus they answered: “Come and see.”
<p>As He had said, he only slept,
 For Christ beheld the shore beyond;
 Yet in his spirit Jesus groaned,
And touched by weeping, Jesus wept!
<p>But still their faith in him He tried
 By bidding them to move the stone;
 Then in a powerful solemn tone
“Come, Lazarus, come forth,” He cried.
<p>He that was dead, lo! he came forth,
 Bound as they laid him dead below;
 “Loose him,” said Christ, “and let him go.”—
A living proof of Jesus’ worth.
<p>Christ called him from the boundless deep<a id="p170"><span class="pagenum">p170</span></a>
 Back into bounds and daily cares,
 To heal bruised hearts and dry sad tears,
And show that death is but a sleep.
<p>He broke the barriers of the grave,
 As God doth all things—by his word,
 As the Messiah, as the Lord,
Whom Heaven had sent the world to save.
</div>

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The final storm commenced to brew,
 And Christ was driven to and fro,
 As the sweet Psalmist long ago,
And that his hour was nigh He knew.
<p>He strayed to seek the far-off sheep,<a id="p171"><span class="pagenum">p171</span></a>
 He taught and headled from ground to ground,
 Perea gladly heard the sound
Of the Everlasting Gospel deep.
<p>And as He moved from place to place,
 With him the people moved along,
 Charmed with the melody of the song
That called them to the God of grace.
<p>While on his way He with delight
 Enlightened many a <span class="noted" title="[sic]; “Zacchaeus’”">Zacheus’</span> mind,
 And cured Timeus’ son—the blind,
But He himself walked into night!
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4><a id="p172"><span class="pagenum">p172</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>One glorious day remained in store,
 Wherein He triumphed for the hour;
 He exercised his sov’reign power
To ride in state as kings of yore.
<p>Not as an earthly potentate,
 Arrayed in purple and fine gold,
 Escorted by bright legions bold,
Not thus He came to his sad fate.
<p>But as the wisest of the wise,
 And as the meekest of the meek,
 He entered on that mournful week
That gave fresh hope to future days.
<p>The Paschal Lamb was chosen that day,<a id="p173"><span class="pagenum">p173</span></a>
 The greatest feast of all the year,
 The Paschal Lamb of God for aye
In that great feast did then appear.
<p>As by a prophet long foretold,
 That oracle came now to pass,
 He on the stately, peaceful ass
Entered the Citadel of gold.
<p>It was His day! He claimed but one,
 A joyful tribute to his life;
The nation hailed the Son of Man
 And drowned in praises scorn and strife!
<p>From Olivet the pass was made,<a id="p174"><span class="pagenum">p174</span></a>
 While loud Hosannas filled the air;
From spur to spur, from shade to shade,
 He came so meek and yet so fair.
<p>Up Kedron’s valley came the song,
 Hosanna in the highest sing!
Hosanna sang the mighty throng,
 Hosanna to Messiah-King!
<p>They waved palm-branches in the breeze,
 They threw their garments in his way;
Hosanna to the Prince of Peace,
 They hailed him as their king that day!
<p>And mightier, mightier rolled the praise,
 Hosanna to the Lord on high;
Hosanna echoed through the skies,
 Hosanna to Messiah’s sway!
<p>As the procession moved along,<a id="p175"><span class="pagenum">p175</span></a>
 The lips of babes refined the strain;
Christ ever comes with palms and song
 As He did then in peace to reign!
</div>

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The fatal storm began to blow,
 The days of Christ grew few and sad;
 As if the demons made men mad,
They hunted him they would not know.
<p>Day after day they tried to snare
 With plot on plot the Son of Man;
 But plot on plot and plan on plan
Returned them naught but dark despair.
<p>He proved himself as keen as they,
 And keener than their subtle arts;
 He mirrored their treacherous hearts
In parables clear from day to day.
<p>They knew him not, so lowly He;<a id="p176"><span class="pagenum">p176</span></a>
 The gorgeous Letter never knew
 The simple Spirit deep and true
That looks to Heaven and makes men free.
<p>They knew him not. Had He come clad
 In heavenly powers to restore
 The throne of David as of yore,
Him they would welcome and be glad!
<p>But Jesus came to set aside
 The rites these men had made so dead;
 And to establish here instead
His Everlasting Kingdom wide.
<p>This truth flashed on them like the sun!
 Though witnessing his works of might,
 The Letter struggled with the Light,
And dying, slew the Promised One.
<p>He by his death became of right<a id="p177"><span class="pagenum">p177</span></a>
 The King of Kings, the Triumphed Lord;
 And it became a vacant word,
A temple emptied of the Light.
</div>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p><span class="noted" title="Replaces “Ah!”">Now</span> numbered were His days and hours,
 That hour was nigh—the fatal one,
 That hour wherein the Son of Man
Yielded himself to cruel powers!
<p>That hour of unforgotten cry,
 Dark as a cloud was winding up,
 That hour that gave the bitter cup
Of woe to Christ, who drank it dry.
<p>Betrayed, as He had long foreseen,
 By one He cherished as a friend,
 By one who had his selfish end,
Whatever its nature might have been.
<p>Betrayed by one who knew him well,<a id="p178"><span class="pagenum">p178</span></a>
 By one who should have died for him,—
 One of the Twelve, by Judas grim,
Made faithless by the Prince of hell.
</div>

<h4>VII.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The false Betrayer to the fold,
 Though having sold in truth the Lord
 For a slave’s price—a mean reward,
Returned again—hypocrisy bold!
<p>He should have known, and well knew he,
 That Jesus read the hearts of men;
 But this dissembler came again
And mixed with the Disciples free.
<p>As Satan moved in days of yore
 Among the sons of God, so now—
 He—Judas–moved with shameless brow
Among the Eleven—a spirit sore.
<p>And sore for what? God only knows.<a id="p179"><span class="pagenum">p179</span></a>
 But sore—sore as an evil sprite,
 As Satan is—sore at the right,
Sore to betray Christ to his foes!
<p>Sore may be for temporal power,
 Which he had thought the Christ would wield;
 Sore that his office did not yield
Less pains, more ease, and better dower.
<p>Sore for the alabaster box
 Of precious ointment—spikenard—
 Which Mary “wasted” on her Lord;
Sore as a sulky hellbound fox.
<p>Ah! sore as he had ever been,
 Sore to be seen and worshipped too,
 That he was false and others true,
Sore that his dark deceit was seen!
<p>And yet with the Disciples he<a id="p180"><span class="pagenum">p180</span></a>
 Still mixed, and in the fold he stayed,
 To seize the Christ he had betrayed,
And consummate his treachery!
<p>Not as the son of darkness grim,
 Not as a wolf within the fold,
 But, as his true Disciples old,
Christ with compassion treated him!
<p>As ere the feast He washed their feet,
 He washed the feet of Judas too;
 Christ gave the Traitor service true,
And he received the service sweet!
<p>And lo! with Him who knew his greed
 He sat at the Passover’s meat;
 He supped with Him—let us repeat—
Whom he had wickedly betrayed!
<p>Being shown by Christ his heart complete<a id="p181"><span class="pagenum">p181</span></a>
 While feasting, he felt sorer still;
 To put in act his wicked will
He made his fatal, lone retreat!
<p>Congenial air! the Blessed Son,
 Among the company divine,
 Then took and blessed the bread and wine,
The Holy Meal gave He each one.
<p>And as He gave, “This do,” said He,
“In fond <span class="noted" title="[sic]">rememberance</span> of me.”
<p>As they partook to them were given
 By Him the sweetest truths of all,
 Those truths that raise the trusting soul
To breathe the living breath of Heaven.
<p>And of the Comforter He spake,<a id="p182"><span class="pagenum">p182</span></a>
 The Spirit of truth whom He would send
 To guide them to their journey’s end,
And in them thoughts of Him awake.
<p>And of his “Father’s house” above,
 The house of many mansions fair,
 A fond discourse He did declare,
And of their meeting there in love.
<p>And for his faithful chosen sheep
 He breathed a solemn tender prayer,
 In whose high-priestly heavenly air
We ever touch his spirit deep.
<p>And singing then a soothing hymn,
 He to the well known garden drew,
 Discoursing still his sweet adieu,
As He went through the shadows dim.

<h3>Canto IV.</h3><a id="p183"><span class="pagenum">p183</span></a>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>When April’s moon moved pale on high
 Through clouds made gray by April’s showers,
 And when the stars, like drooping flowers
Of sadness, decked the weeping sky;
<p>When all the throngs retired to sleep,
 And calm reigned o’er the City blest,
 All but his enemies were at rest,
When Jesus crossed the Kedron deep.
<p>Behold He crossed—He crossed the Brook!
 <span class="unclear" title="faded handwriting">And as</span> He entered into the dark,
 The hounds of hell in wrath did bark,
And all the Powers of darkness shook!
<p>But Heaven rejoiced. Triumphant strain,<a id="p184"><span class="pagenum">p184</span></a>
 Anticipating victory,
 Resounded though eternity
From everlasting harps divine!
<p>What strains poured forth the golden lyres
 Of Patriarchs and Prophets old,
 As they perceived their Saviour bold
Confronting calmly Satan’s fires!
<p>As Jesus and his sad Eleven
 Walked <span class="noted" title="Replaces “towards Gethsemane”">slowly to the Garden</span> fair,
 The Evil One, wrought by despair,
Encompassed him as well as Heaven.
<p>That garden oft had been the place
Where with the Father face to face
He held communion sweet, profound,
As He the depth of life did sound.
<p>But now the Cross before him stood,<a id="p185"><span class="pagenum">p185</span></a>
 The agony of knowing death—
 Of yielding up his latest breath,
And giving for the race his blood.
<p>He shrank from death much more than we,
 In Him nor sin, nor death had naught;
 Ah! to the sinless Christ the thought
Of death was pain beyond degree!
<p>His nature from the agony shrank
 As purest innocence from sin;
 This was the cup—the fear within,
And yet this cup of death He drank.
<p>Withdrawing from his chosen three
 To Gethsemane’s deepest shade,
 In untold sorrow Jesus prayed
That from this fear He might be free.
<p>And while He prayed the Evil Power,<a id="p186"><span class="pagenum">p186</span></a>
 By Satan led, assaulted him,
 As if beneath the shadows dim
It would have slain him in that hour.
<p>Who can depict Christ’s agony
 As He returned from where He prayed,
 As one that was almost dismayed,
In search of human sympathy?
<p>His faithful three, o’ercome by sleep,
 Could not <span class="unclear" title="“even”? Or corrected already?">e’en</span> watch with him one hour;
 Again He went to pray for power
To Him who knew his anguish deep.
<p>He was so smitten by the foe,
 That, as great drops of blood, his sweat
 Fell on the frosty ground, and yet
His travail lasted and his woe!
<p>And from the depth the Saviour cried:<a id="p187"><span class="pagenum">p187</span></a>
 “Not my will, Father, thine be done.”
 Such was the prayer of the Son,
As He was in the garden tried.
<p>Returning to the three again,
 And slumbering still the three He found,
 Although He yearned for the least sound
Of sympathy from mortal men.
<p>His sorrow grew in conflict grim!
 Withdrawing, again He wrought in prayer,
 And while He prayed an angel fair
Reanimated hope in him.
<p>Dejectedly withdrew the foe:
 We may in Gethsemane boast,
 Though all the race in Eden lost,
<span class="corrected" title="Crist">Christ</span> to the galling Cross did go!
</div>

<h4>II.</h4><a id="p188"><span class="pagenum">p188</span></a>

<div class="poem"><p>“Sleep ye on now and take your rest.”
 Thus spoke the Saviour to the three,
 As from the garden’s agony
He did emerge so self-possessed.
<p>He was prepared now to restrain,
 Whate’er betide, his power within;
 And unto God for human sin
Make ransom of his life divine.
<p>And while He spoke through yonder gloom
 Approached the throng by Judas led,
 To take the Saviour to his dread,
Precounseled, sacrificial doom.
<p>The Traitor gave the token foul;<a id="p189"><span class="pagenum">p189</span></a>
 He kissed the Son, but lost his soul.
<p>Approaching them, “Whom do ye seek?”
 Said Christ, and backward fell the foe;
 His majesty struck them with awe,
They fell unnerved like sucklings weak.
<p>Again He queried, “Whom seek ye?”
 “The Nazarene,” they answered all;
 And then He poured to death his soul
While He thus answered—“I am he.”
<p>When Peter saw being bound his Lord,
 He the fiery and faithful one,
 True to himself and days by-gone,
As brave as swift struck with his sword.
<p>Christ healed the wound, and thus said He:<a id="p190"><span class="pagenum">p190</span></a>
 “Peace, Peter, peace; put up thy sword;
 Were I delivered, how the word
Of Scripture should accomplished be?”
<p>Christ suffered to be led away,
 An angel among demons bold;
 Meek as a lamb as long foretold,
He bore the shame without a sigh.
<p>The angel that inspired him
 While in the garden’s agony sore,
 Could not describe the pains He bore
In these dread hours of darkness dim.
<p>Enrobed in clay, Divinity
 Was rudely taken by the throng,
 And treated like a child of wrong,
And plunged in all ignominy!
<p>Ah! stricken was the Teacher fair,<a id="p191"><span class="pagenum">p191</span></a>
And scattered the Disciples were.

<div class="poem"><p>“Art thou the Christ—the Promised One—
 The hope of <span class="corrected" title="Isreal">Israel</span> and his stay,
 For whom the nation look and pray,—
 Art thou the Christ—art thou the Son

 And haughty pontiff—the high priest,
 <span class="corrected" title="Quiered">Queried</span> the Saviour. Not the least
Disturbed,—calm as a summer cloud
<p>The Saviour answered, “I am he.”
 Yes, He who found in Eden fair
 The race when lost in deep despair,
And gave the primal promise free;
<p>Whom Enoch loved and Abraham knew,<a id="p192"><span class="pagenum">p192</span></a>
 And Jacob wrestled with in prayer,
 The great “I am” who from the glare
Spoke to the prophet Moses true.
<p>Yes, He who led the chosen seed
 From bondage to the promised land,
 Who sits today at God’s right hand,
And won for us the peaceful meed.
<p>“Thou dost blaspheme,” the Pontiff cried,
 As he his holy vestment tore,
 “Away with Him, take Him before
The ruler Pilate to be tried.”
<p>Two honest hearts among the throng,
 Two honest hearts for him did beat,
 As He before the Pontiff’s seat
Stood stricken and accused of wrong!
<p>Ah! Peter’s heart, like John’s, was right,<a id="p193"><span class="pagenum">p193</span></a>
 His words voiced not his inmost soul;
 And notwithstanding his sad fall,
He, weeping, followed still the Light.

<div class="poem"><p>Ah! Pilate weak, wilt thou the dust—
 Wilt thou condemn in thy brief reign—
 Wilt thou condemn the Man Divine—
Condemn to cursèd death the Just?
<p>With thou condemn the Son of God

 Wilt thou not use thy power to halt
The rage of envy with thy rod?
<p>A king He is, as He has said,

He honored thee and <span class="corrected" title="Ceasar’s">Caesar’s</span> law.
<p>Ah! thou dost hear the furious cry,
 Led by the wily rulers fell,
 And lo! again the urgent yell
Arises! “Crucify! Crucify!”
<p><span class="noted" title="Replaces “The goddess”">Impartial</span> Justice calls to thee<a id="p195"><span class="pagenum">p195</span></a>

<p>Oh, hear again the common cry!
 “Not this man—Barrabas set free,
 Our king is <span class="corrected" title="Ceasar">Caesar</span>—only he,
Crucify Jesus! Crucify!”
<p>Why didst thou, Pilate, scourge the Good?
 Thou canst not melt these hearts of stone,
 Thy sense of right and that alone
Can only save his guiltless blood!
<p>Thy consort Portia deems Him just,
 And so dost thou. Do what is right,
 Though day should turn to utter night
And thy throne crumble into dust!
<p>“If now this man thou wilt release<a id="p196"><span class="pagenum">p196</span></a>
 Thou art not <span class="corrected" title="Ceasar’s">Caesar’s</span> friend,” cry they:
Wash not thy hands, O Pilate! Cease!
 Thou canst not wash thy guilt away,
Although thy basin be the seas!

<h4>V.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>“Behold the man,” the Governor cried.
 Mysterious man indeed thought he,
 And fain he would have set Him free;
But whom of fear he crucified!
<p>Bound by the soldiers Christ was driven,
 Bearing the Cross which now doth bloom,
 To Calvary—the place of doom,
The sacrifice of Earth and Heaven.
<p>Scourged and exhausted as was He,<a id="p197"><span class="pagenum">p197</span></a>
 Beneath the heavy beam He fell;
 Though bruised by man and bruised by hell,
The Saviour walked to victory.
<p>And as He went, “Weep not for me,
Ye Salem’s daughters,” muttered He,
“But for yourselves and children weep;
The holy wrath of God is deep.”
<p>As Jesus’ cross was lifted up,
 “Forgive them, Father,” was his prayer;
 “Of what they do they are not aware;
Put to my lips their bitter cup.”
<p>Take back that stupefying drink!
 The pain of death the Christ would know,
 He would die conscious of his woe,
From death’s keen pangs He would not shrink.
<p>He to the Virgin spoke this word:<a id="p198"><span class="pagenum">p198</span></a>
 “Henceforth behold in John thy son”;
 To the beloved disciple John,
“Behold thy mother,” said the Lord.
<p>Vicarious pain! we do not know
 What Jesus suffered for the race,
 When God the Father hid his face,
And Christ lamented in his woe!
<p>“My God! my God! O why hast thou
 Forsaken me?” was Jesus’ wail;
 Alone the Saviour did prevail
O’er all his foes on Calvary’s brow.
<p>One malefactor did upbraid;
The other in his anguish prayed:
<p>“Remember me when thou wilt rise<a id="p199"><span class="pagenum">p199</span></a>
 To thy eternal throne,” prayed he;
 “Thou shalt,” said Jesus, “be with me
This very day in Paradise.”
<p>“Lo! it is finished,” cried the Lord.
 When He had bowed his head in death
 Faith, Hope, and Love drew freer breath,
And Justice sheathed his righteous sword.
<p>Why didst thou, Sun, in darkness hide
 While He—the Son of God—did die?
Could not thy brightness then abide
 The sight and hear his sorrowful cry?
<p>Why didst thou quake, O Earth, that day
 When <span class="corrected" title="Crist">Christ</span> was nailed upon the cross?
 O didst thou feel a partial loss
Of that strong Power which is thy stay?
<p>Creation shook, the dead did rise,<a id="p200"><span class="pagenum">p200</span></a>
 As to the grave He did descend;
 The Temple’s veil in twain did rend
As He ascended to the skies.
<p>As on the cross the Saviour died,
 He bruised the wily Serpent’s head,
 And spoiled the Powers of darkness dread,
And by his death atonement made.
</div>

<h4>VI.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>From Jesus’ death there sprang a power
 That works at present in all parts,
 That brought conviction to the hearts
Of many in his dying hour.
<p>What meant the keen Centurion’s nod
 As from the cross he did withdraw?
 He judged by what he heard and saw
That Jesus was the Son of God.
<p>O why did Joseph grow more brave,<a id="p201"><span class="pagenum">p201</span></a>
 And Nicodemus show his faith?
 They found fresh courage by his death,
And Christ through Joseph found a grave.
<p>In vain they sealed that massive stone,
 In vain they watched that garden grave,
 The Christ, that died mankind to save,
Arose to occupy his throne.
<p>For when the third day’s earliest gleam
 Awoke the garden’s blushing bloom,
 The Prince of Life rose from the tomb,
And in its darkness left a beam.
<p>Ah! Thomas felt the chastening rod,
 As he beheld the Risen One
 Among them as he oft had done,
As he exclaimed, ”My Lord, my God!”
<p>The resurrection of the Christ<a id="p202"><span class="pagenum">p202</span></a>
 Made Peter firmer than a rock
 As a conductor of the flock,
And as a bold evangelist.
<p>The Risen Christ for forty days,
 As He was wont in days of old,
 Himself made visible in the fold,—
So natural—without surprise.
<p>From Olivet’s exalted clime,
 Surrounded by his people dear,
 He did ascend and disappear
Till He shall come the second time.
<p>And as we look beyond the sun
 To the sublimest power that be,
 Believing, we rejoice to see
Enthronèd there the Promised One.

<h3>Canto V.</h3><a id="p203"><span class="pagenum">p203</span></a>

<h4>I.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>How beautiful this world of ours,
 And hung on naught in boundless space;
 How beautiful its varied face,
And musical are all its powers.
<p>How beautiful the starry <span class="noted" title="Replaces “sky”">way</span>,
 And how divine the dreamy night,
 When earthly gloom, baptized with light,
Appears more spiritual than the day.
<p>How beautiful the wakeful morn,
 And how seraphic is the sun,
 As from his orbit he doth run
The tuneful seasons <span class="noted" title="Replaces “in their turn”">to adorn</span>.
<p>How beautiful the aged hills,<a id="p204"><span class="pagenum">p204</span></a>
 The guardian angels of the dales,
 How beautiful the shady vales,
And charming are the running rills.
<p>We love this globe’s variety,
 These worlds of water and of land,
 As lands and oceans hand in hand
Are melting into melody.
<p>The wild notes of the woods we hail,
 And the majestic eagle’s flight;
 And oh! we love the deeper light
That breaks through Nature’s silken veil.
<p>We seek the deeper notes within,
 We listen for the “still small voice”;
 In all this world we do rejoice,
In all but in its sorrowful sin.
<p>Christ came this blemish to remove,<a id="p205"><span class="pagenum">p205</span></a>
 And cleanse it from its sinful stain,
 And make it all a pure domain
Of everlasting peace and love.
</div>

<h4>II.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>This universal truth we feel,
 Whatever be our chosen creed,
 We feel it as we feel our need,
That we have lost our pristine weal.
<p>As in a dream we look behind
 To catch at something we have lost;
 It ever, like a flitting ghost,
Slips from the grasping of the mind.
<p>We cannot give it shape and form,<a id="p206"><span class="pagenum">p206</span></a>
 And yet that we have lost we know,
 Lost chart and anchor long ago,
In some far-off, terrific storm.
<p>We feel an emptiness—a sin,
 A constant longing of the heart,
 As if as yet we live apart
From Him who gives true peace within.
<p>Ah! nothing but the Infinite
 Can satisfy the longing heart;
 Ah! nothing but the nobler part
Which Mary chose can set us right.
<p>And learning at the Saviour’s feet,
 And drinking from the Fount of bliss,
 The inward voice in filled with his
Most sympathetic Presence sweet.
<p>Christ being human and divine,<a id="p207"><span class="pagenum">p207</span></a>
 He knows the mind of God and man;
 And having human will, He can
Bear with these weaknesses of <span class="noted" title="“(mine)” in the margin">thine</span>.
<p>Him we obey and him we sing,
 To him we yield our heart and will;
 We are his subjects, and He still
Supremely reigns in every thing.
<p>He rules the sun and moon and stars,
 The golden seasons from him spring;
 He even rules the smallest thing,
And over-rules the rage of wars.
<p>Lo! by his power <span class="noted" title="Replaces “He doth”">doth He</span> uphold
 In being the creation all;
 His Providence is in the Fall,
In budding Spring, and Winter <span class="noted" title="[sic]">old</span>.
<p>We do believe in all our care,<a id="p208"><span class="pagenum">p208</span></a>
 In all this world of shifting sand,
 That they who trust in Him shall stand,
And be declared the victors fair.

<h4>III.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>This world hath many teachers seen,
 Their teaching still retains its youth,
 And charmingly they spoke of truth,
Their memories still are dear and green.
<p>They rose above their common kind,
 They wrote and sang of highest things;
 And as possessed of angel-wing,
Exposed the regions of the mind.
<p>They wrote of morals and of law,
 And of true liberty they taught;
 But of the truth and of the thought
They spoke, and left the world in woe.
<p>Of gods and goddesses they spoke,<a id="p209"><span class="pagenum">p209</span></a>
 And blindest destinties of men;
 The future of mankind was then
Enwrapt in clouds and darkest smoke.
<p><em>Then</em> blessèd were the proud and bold,
 And blessèd were the men of might,
 And blessèd they who wronged the right,
And slew the weak and crushed the old.
<p><em>Then</em> blessèd were the souls unkind,
 And the oppressor’s mighty hands,
 <em>Then</em> blessèd were the cruel bands
That bound the freedom of the mind.
<p>And as to Prophecy we look,
 And give the prophets bold our ear,
 Repeatedly these words we hear,
“Thus saith the Lord,” throughout the Book.
<p>They were the channel, not the stream,<a id="p210"><span class="pagenum">p210</span></a>
 They were the means, but not the grace;
 They bore, like Moses’ shining face,
Reflections of the Spiritual beam.
<p>They spoke as they were moved to speak,
 They wrote as they were moved to write;
 They thought and spoke when moved aright,
But they themselves were mortals weak.
<p>Deep voices they of Prophecy,
 And of the Christ they did foretell,
 Of Him who is the very well
Of truth from all Eternity.
</div>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<div class="poem"><p>The Christ is the Prophet to be,
 Experienced, so true, unperplext,
 He knoweth this world and the next,
The spring of all knowledge is He.
<p>He knoweth our sorrows and strife,<a id="p211"><span class="pagenum">p211</span></a>
 He knoweth the passions of souls,
 He knoweth the dangerous shoals,
<span class="noted" title="Replaces “And the”">The</span> treacherous sand-banks of life.
<p>He came from the Father above,
 He came on the wings of the dawn,
 And dwelt in the earth with his own,
And died of his infinite love.
<p>Though humble and low of estate,
 He perfectly knew
 The whole in each part,
 And as it were spoke
 From eternity’s heart,
Creator of being and fate!
<p>He stood on the rostrum of time,<a id="p212"><span class="pagenum">p212</span></a>
 <span class="noted" title="Replaces “And”">But</span> spoke all the wisdom of God;
 The flowers that grow on the heavenly sod
He scattered in language sublime.
<p>He spoke from the depth of his soul;
 He taught what He thought,
 He spoke what He knew,
 And as it were brought
 The Invisible to view;
And brought life immortal for all.
<p>And now we are taught in the Word
 Where we the Almighty may find;
 And now we may read the Absolute Mind
In Christ our Redeemer and Lord.
<p>The root of his being, He knew,
 Was grounded in Godhead—not birth,
 Immaculate Heaven and Earth
Were wedded in Jesus anew.
<p>The Prophet of prophets is He,<a id="p213"><span class="pagenum">p213</span></a>
 Ere long all the nations will meet,
 In faith and in hope at his feet,
His glory eternal to see.

<div class="poem"><p>Before the ocean knew its shore,
 Before the stars in lustre shone,
 Ere in the sky beamed forth the sun,
A prophet’s mantle Jesus wore.
<p>Before an angel bright did soar
 Upon the breeze of life and love,
 In the eternal world above,
A prophet’s mantle Jesus wore.
<p>But as the Son of Man He wore
 A prophet’s mantle in full sway,
 And lo! as such He reigns to-day
From sea to sea, from shore to shore.
<p>He is his own authority,<a id="p214"><span class="pagenum">p214</span></a>
 His words performed what He did will;
 Each thought is like a living rill
That ever flows in <span class="corrected" title="ecstacy">ecstasy</span>.
<p>How full of thought the words He spoke!
 They bloom in beauty like the flowers
 That breathe beneath the April showers,
As just to life they had awoke.
<p>The prophets all prefigured him,
 They were the lights before the dawn;
 Messiah shines and by his own
Eternal light in darkness dim.
<p>The fountain of all reason He,
 By him we reason as we ought;
 He is the spring of human thought,
The very source of prophecy.
<p>He taught, but not as others taught;<a id="p215"><span class="pagenum">p215</span></a>
 The powers of the world to come
 Struck those who heard him almost dumb;
They found in him more than they sought.
<p>He thought, but not as others thought;
 The most original was He
 In Time as in Eternity,
And with authority He taught.
<p>And as authority divine,
 He gave the old a larger scope;
 He raised the horizon of hope
Much higher than the ancient line.

<div class="poem"><p>Faint heart! have faith, thy knocks repeat,

 And though thy sins as crimson be,
Thou mayst approach the mercy-seat.
<p>And as thy priest him do adore:<a id="p216"><span class="pagenum">p216</span></a>
 He is the new and living way
 That leads to where the glory stay,
Where mercy smiles forever more.
<p>And lo! in him thou now dost have
 An able advocate above,
 An advocate whose plea is love,
And who is mightiest to save.
<p>And as thy priest He hath been made
 Infallible through suffering pain;
 His Priesthood ever shall remain,
Though sun and moon and stars shall fade.
<p>Priests for a time were they of old,
 And fallible as men were they;
 All shadows now have passed away,
And as a tale that hath been told.
<p>He entered not the Holy Place<a id="p217"><span class="pagenum">p217</span></a>
 By merits other than his own;
 He entered by his worth alone,
And wrought the freedom of the race.
<p>He standeth in the Holy Place,
 The Son of Man—the Son of God,
 The Prophet-Priest of royal blood,
The great High Priest of truth and grace.
<p>Thy Priest, thy Prophet, and thy King,
 Thy sole Redeemer and thy Lord;
 And may thy will with his accord,
And may thy love his praises sing.
<p>Through Him thou mayst approach the throne
 Of God and ever be forgiven,
 And find at last sweet rest in heaven,
In knowing Him as thou art known.
