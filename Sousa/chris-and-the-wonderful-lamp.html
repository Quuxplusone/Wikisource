<p>This is Glen MacDonough and John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>Chris and the Wonderful Lamp</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>So far, this is just a transcription of
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-W09AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1">the piano/vocal score</a>
published 1899 by the John Church Company.
I lack a (public-domain) source for the book, except for a small fragment of
dialogue in Act I found in the Library of Congress’ Sousa collection (box 7).

<p>The Library of Congress’ Sousa collection (box 7) contains unfinished drafts
of many other songs that may have formed part of <i>Chris</i> at one time or
another (or never). See the section of “<a href="#apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>”
that comes after the operetta proper on this page.

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

<p> The Fourth of July has its meed of joy,
 And Washington’s birthday our thoughts employ;
 &emsp; But naught, not even a circus clown,
 &emsp; Can waken the folks of this old town
 &emsp; Like auction sales, for in that case,

 &emsp; Without regard to rank or race,
 Finds pleasure without alloy.

 &emsp; With statuettes that seemingly speak;
 &emsp; Old guns and pistols, very unique;
 Will all be sold off to-day.
<p> We never bid high on the goods for sale;
 Connecticut thriftiness must prevail.
 &emsp; But when a bargain comes our way,
 &emsp; Our “grab-it-quick” instincts we obey.
 &emsp; We know a gold brick in the dark,
 &emsp; Likewise a buzzard from a lark;
 &emsp; Therefore we’re not an easy mark
 For sharpers—they always fail.

 It’s ever been thus since the world began;
 No doubt it’s encompassed in Nature’s plan.
 ’Tis foolish to buy a pig in a poke,
 To crawl in a cannon to have a smoke,
 To try to fight a young buzz-saw,
 Or plead your case in a court of law.

<p> When in curls and knickerbockers, quite a very little lad,
 &emsp; To the late lamented Sypher I was sent.
 Then his health, as I recall it, was phenomenally bad,
 &emsp; And nearly were the sands of his existence spent.
 He recuperated suddenly, and to me it was due
 &emsp; That he hale and hearty died at eighty-three.
 It was strong and constant exercise gave him his health anew
 &emsp; For just three hours a day he spent in licking me.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> And the recollection haunts him yet!
<span class="left sc">Chris</span> &emsp; Great sentiment it lacks.
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Though he vainly struggles to forget—
<span class="left sc">Chris</span> &emsp; The rhythm of the whacks.
<p> The patter, the patter, the patter of the shingle—
 &emsp; To use it he well knew how.
 He’d batter, he’d batter, he’d batter till I tingle;
 &emsp; In mem’ry I feel it now.

 &emsp; In the little village schoolhouse on the green,
 Then it stood within a leafy grove all shady, dark, and cool;

 It had disappeared completely, leaving not a single tree.
 &emsp; By old Sypher they were felled and sent away
 To be sliced up into shingles that were meant alone for me;
 &emsp; A gross of them I often wore out in a day.

 That land of High-Art Posters that we see upon the fences.

 For living in that blessed spot a moderate expense is.
 Therefore, I beg, take heart and slip the stern parental tether;
 We’ll wedded be and then depart for Posterland together.

 &emsp; How fortunate indeed our fate

 Vermilion cows are to this land exclusively allotted;

 A peacock’s craved, with its gaudy hue.

 The peacock’s tail with a cross-cut saw.
 And then he stuck the feathers on his own extremitee,
 But somehow couldn’t manage to fly up above the sea!

 Over gutters lightly skipping,
 While quite correctly tripping
 &emsp; Down Broadway.
<p><span class="left sc">Genie</span> Etheria at last we’ve found;
 &emsp; A dead slow place it is.
 No trolley cars go buzzing ’round;
 &emsp; No automobiles whiz.
 For it I do not care a cent;
 Away from town I’m ne’er content.
 I’d swap this mystic Orient
 &emsp; For one small bot of fizz!
<p><span class="left sc">Others</span> Naughty, very!
<span class="left sc">Genie</span> &emsp; My townward way I’d like to wend.
<span class="left sc">Others</span> In a hurry!
<span class="left sc">Chris</span> &emsp; You may be right, at that.

<p>This comic song has manuscript lyrics (3pp)
in the Library of Congress’ Sousa collection (box 7 folder 2).
The three pages are numbered 1, 3, and 4. Page 4 ends with a
blue crayon annotation: “etc. etc.”

<div class="song">
<p> If I’m to be a cipher in this worky, weary world—
 &emsp; And it seems the one best bet that I’m to be—
 &emsp; &emsp; I’ve devoted time and thought
 &emsp; &emsp; To the character of nought
 &emsp; That possesses most attractiveness for me.
 &emsp; &emsp; I’ve been figuring to know
 &emsp; &emsp; The special kind of “O”
 &emsp; That has the most attractiveness for me!
<p> [<i>second verse apparently missing</i>]
<p> I’ve often thought I’d like to be the atmospheric space
 &emsp; In the middle of a doughnut brown and small.
 &emsp; &emsp; And without me doughnuts would
 &emsp; &emsp; Not be nearly half so good;
 &emsp; In point of fact, they wouldn’t be at all!
 &emsp; &emsp; Only think—to be an “O”
 &emsp; &emsp; Compassed all about by dough—
 &emsp; Which, if it were gone, you wouldn’t be at all!
<p> At times I’ve longed to be the hole within a dotted Swissy cheese,
 &emsp; Or an eyelet on a lovely lady’s shoe;
 &emsp; &emsp; And attraction seems to lurk
 &emsp; &emsp; In the meshy open work—
 &emsp; I could be the “nought” of naughty peek-a-boo!
 &emsp; &emsp; I should love, upon my soul,
 &emsp; &emsp; To be nothing but a hole—
 &emsp; It’s the most important part of peek-a-boo.

<p>A fragment of orchestral score for this piece (3pp), with
these lyrics, is in the Library of Congress’ Sousa collection (box 7 folder 10).
The third page is dated “John Philip Sousa, Washington, D. C., Nov 18th 99.”

<div class="song">
<p><span class="left sc">Fanny</span> The swagger of the boys as they gaily march
 &emsp; To the sound of the regimental bands,
 And the flashing dashing air of the General
 &emsp; As he shouts forth his orders and commands,
 Together with the horses’ graceful step
 &emsp; As up the avenue they prance,
 Makes a picture that thrills ev’ry patriot soul
 &emsp; With its glamour and its weird romance.

<p>The Library of Congress’ Sousa collection (box 7 folder 3) also
contains one page of manuscript score marked “Chris,” which is in fact
an early draft of <i>American Maid’s</i> “In the dimness of twilight.”
Someone, presumably a curator, has penciled at the top, “Not in Sousa’s hand.”
