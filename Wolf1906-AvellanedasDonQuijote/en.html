and its adaptation by Lesage.</h2><br>

<h3-em>First Part</h3-em>.<br>
<h3>Avellaneda and Cervantes.</h3>
</center>

<p>After Cervantes had made the public wait nine years for the promised
second part of his <i>Don Quijote</i>, in the year 1614 appeared an
apocryphal second part under the title <i>Segundo Tomo del
ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha por el Licenciado Alonso
Fernandez de Avellaneda</i>. This book would certainly have received
as little attention in the following years as other inferior sequels
to important works, had not Cervantes himself in his second part
drawn posterity’s attention to it.
The crime of plagiarism, however, was not so rare for that epoch and
not so great in that instance as it might seem from Cervantes’ behavior
and the statements of later critics of Avellaneda. We see in the
false <i>Quijote</i> merely another example of the mania for sequels
that arose in the Spanish literature of the 16th and 17th centuries
and by which few works of any significance were left untouched.
The <i>Celestina</i> by Fernando de Rojas opens the series with about
twenty sequels and imitations.
It is followed by the <i>Amadis de Gaula</i> and other famous
chivalric romances, the <i>Diana</i> by Jorge de Montemayor, and the <i>Lazarillo de Tormes</i>.
Under very similar circumstances to the false <i>Quijote</i>,
<a id="p2"><span class="pagenum">p2</span></a>
a sequel to Mateo Alemán’s <i>Guzman de Alfarache</i> was
published in Valencia in 1602<a class="ref" id="ref2.1" href="#note2.1">1</a>
under the pseudonym “Mateo Luxan de Sayavedra.”
Thanks to Alemán’s clear clues we can easily identify Luxan de Sayavedra as
Juan Martí, a Valencian lawyer; but the question of who authored the
false <i>Quijote</i> has never yet been answered satisfactorily.
Here, too, we deal with an assumed name. Since the book itself offered no clues,
the investigation has focused mainly on Avellaneda’s preface and on Cervantes’
statements. This is why Avellaneda’s work has not yet been examined for its
literary value or at least for its literary status. I have attempted to do so
in this work; I hope that a comparison of the false <i>Quijote</i>
with its model will also be fruitful for the assessment of the original work.
Avellaneda’s book has some significance for French literature because Lesage
began his career as a novelist with a free adaptation of it. That novel of
Lesage’s will be the subject of the second part of this work.

<p>
<center><h3-em>1. Reception and Distribution.</h3-em></center>

<p>Avellaneda’s sequel to <i>Don Quijote</i> seems to have met with no
literary success. Contemporaries are completely silent about it; even in
Lope de Vega’s extensive correspondence with the Duke of
Sessa,<a class="ref" id="ref2.2" href="#note2.2">2</a> in which
otherwise all important literary events were
reflected, it is never mentioned. The only evidence of Avellaneda’s book
from the 17th century is a short note in Nicolás Antonio’s <i>Bibliotheca Hispana Nova</i>
(1672–1679),<a class="ref" id="ref2.3" href="#note2.3">3</a>
containing little more than what is given in the book’s own title.
In the 17th century no new edition appeared, so that the book was
<a id="p3"><span class="pagenum">p3</span></a>
by Lesage’s time<a class="ref" id="ref3.1" href="#note3.1">1</a>
already extremely rare. It is therefore incomprehensible to me
that Puisbusque<a class="ref" id="ref3.2" href="#note3.2">2</a>
would ask: “How is it that Avellaneda’s so-called continuation, filled with
invective against the author, had more success than the work itself?”

<p>Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> has been <em>published in Spanish</em>
six times.<a class="ref" id="ref3.3" href="#note3.3">3</a>

<p>It has been <em>translated</em> twice into
French,<a class="ref" id="ref4.1" href="#note4.1">1</a>
and three (really, two) times into
English.<a class="ref" id="ref4.2" href="#note4.2">2</a>

<p>Of <em>Lesage’s adaptation</em> there
<a id="p5"><span class="pagenum">p5</span></a>
have been six French editions, as well as translations into
English, Dutch, and German.<a class="ref" id="ref5.1" href="#note5.1">1</a>

<p>This demonstrates that only in Lesage’s adaptation has
Avellaneda’s sequel found much reception. Of the six Spanish editions,
three are of purely academic interest. Nevertheless, we find
no traces left by Lesage’s book in the later French literature.

<p>A translation of Lesage’s <i>Don Quichotte</i> must also have come
into Alexander Pope’s hands and provided him with material for a remark
in his <i>Essay
on Criticism</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref5.2" href="#note5.2">2</a>
A passage in Laurence Sterne’s <i>Sentimental
Journey</i><a class="ref" id="ref5.3" href="#note5.3">3</a> cited by
Becker<a class="ref" id="ref5.4" href="#note5.4">4</a> has its original
in Lesage’s Chapter&nbsp;6.

<p>
<center><h3-em>2. The Authorship Question.</h3-em></center>

<p>The frequent allusions that Cervantes makes to Avellaneda, from Chapter&nbsp;59
of Part&nbsp;II onwards, and the keenness with which he responds to his
attacks, must have amazed every reader of
<a id="p6"><span class="pagenum">p6</span></a>
a later period. His contemporaries may have known exactly who they were
dealing with. As long as there has been interest in Cervantes’ biography,
his imitator has therefore also received unusual attention.
Once it was established that they were dealing with a pseudonym —
there was no need for the proof of
Isidro Perales<a class="ref" id="ref6.1" href="#note6.1">1</a> —
the question of the true author of the spurious second part came to the fore.
It was hoped that its solution would also provide information about Cervantes’
literary disputes and the allusions contained in the first part.
But despite about one hundred and sixty years of effort by the Cervantists
to unmask the plagiarist, no satisfactory solution to the authorship
question has yet been provided.

<p><em>Gregorio Mayáns y Siscár</em>,<a class="ref" id="ref6.2" href="#note6.2">2</a>
the first biographer of the famous Spaniard,
expresses himself reservedly: “Those words
(in the Prologue to Cervantes’ Part II) <i>señor</i> and <i>grande</i> are mysterious
to me; whatever the truth was, I am persuaded that Cervantes’ foe must have been
very powerful, since a writer, a soldier, bold and dextrous with
both the pen and the sword, did not dare to name him. Or else it is that
he was a man so low and contemptible that Cervantes wished nobody even
to learn his name, so as not to raise him, by infamy, to fame.”
If Cervantes calls Avellaneda <i>señor autor</i>, this hardly expresses respect;
but he never calls him <i>grande</i>; it seems to me that this is based on a
misunderstanding. Cervantes writes:
<span class="Cerv"><i>“la (afflicción) que debe tener este señor sin duda es grande ...”</i></span>

<p>While <em>Padre Murillo</em> in his <i>Geographia historica</i> (1752)
[<a href="https://archive.org/details/bdh0000000396/page/n3387/mode/1up">X.1</a>]
claims that Avellaneda must have been a clergyman,
<em>Vicente de los Ríos</em><a class="ref" id="ref6.3" href="#note6.3">3</a>
goes further and says that he must have been a bishop.
He also assumes that he was of Aragonese origin, per <i>D. Q.</i> II.59;
and suspects that he was a comedy writer who felt offended by some hidden criticism
of his comedies in the first part.
<em>Pellicer</em><a class="ref" id="ref6.4" href="#note6.4">4</a>
tries to substantiate the former assumption even further by
<a id="p7"><span class="pagenum">p7</span></a>
giving some examples from the language of the book. He also claims that Avellaneda was
a Dominican, because of the frequent mention of the Dominican order in his book
and because of the prominent role played by the cult of the Virgin Mary
and the devotion to the Rosary. He believes he has found allusions to Avellaneda’s work
in two <i>vejámenes</i> contained in the Codex
Fernán Núñez and taken from a <i>certamen</i> that took place on 16 October 1614,
on the occasion of the beatification of Santa Teresa de Jesús in Zaragoza.
However, this is unlikely.
Rather, it likely relates to a student<a class="ref" id="ref7.1" href="#note7.1">1,</a><a class="ref" id="ref7.2" href="#note7.2">2</a>
who took part in the <i>certamen</i> in the guise of Sancho
Panza and received no prize.
It reads: <i>“Á Sancho Panza, estudiante, / Oficial ó paseante, / Cosa
justa á su talento, / Le dará el verdugo ciento,<a class="ref" id="ref7.3" href="#note7.3">3</a> /
Caballero en Rocinante.”</i> The content of the other satirical poem is very similar.
The relatively gentle treatment that Cervantes bestows on his opponent Pellicer
tries to explain by saying that Avellaneda, as a Dominican and an Aragonese, enjoyed
the protection of the king’s confessor, Fray Luis de Aliaga.<a class="ref" id="ref7.4" href="#note7.4">4</a>

<p>Thus we have established some points toward the identity of the author.
For the hypotheses now to be discussed, each to be aimed at a specific personage,
the foregoing materials lead us to draw up the following guidelines:

<p>1.&nbsp; Avellaneda must by Cervantes’ Book I have been insulted in some way (see his Prologue).
<p>2.&nbsp; This insult was delivered via some personal allusion (<span class="Av"><i>“sinónimos voluntarios”</i></span> [“gratuitous aliases”]?),
in the <i>escrutinio</i> <nobr>(<i>D. Q.</i> I.6),</nobr> or in the criticism of comedy <nobr>(<i>D. Q.</i> I.48).</nobr>
<p>3.&nbsp; He was a writer of comedies; or at least he was a writer.
<p>4.&nbsp; He was a friend of Lope de Vega’s (see Avellaneda’s Prologue).
<p>5.&nbsp; He must, if not been a monk, at least have studied theology
<a id="p8"><span class="pagenum">p8</span></a>
(cf. Pellicer, <i>op.&nbsp;cit.,</i> <nobr><a href="https://archive.org/details/vidademigueldece00pell/page/159">pages 159 ff.</a>).</nobr>
<p>6.&nbsp; He was Aragonese <nobr>(<i>D. Q.</i> II.59).</nobr>
<p>7.&nbsp; He knew Zaragoza and Alcalá (Av. Cap. XXII, XXIII, and XXVI).

<p><em>Ceán Bermúdez</em>, in 1808, was the first to identify a
specific person as the author of the <i>Don Quijote</i>, namely
Fr. Juan Blanco de Paz of Estremadura; since then a host of new
hypotheses have emerged. Some of these are self-refuting —
Luis de Granada (d.&nbsp;1595), Pedro Liñán (d.&nbsp;1609), Gabriel
Téllez (who did not emerge as a writer until 1613) —
and some have been refuted elsewhere (Juan Ruiz de Alarcón, Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola,
Andrés Pérez, etc.), so we may here restrict ourselves
to those theories which, due to their recent origin or due to the support they
have found, require particular discussion.

<p>The most successful was the <em>Aliaga</em> theory, put forth in
1846 by <em>Adolfo de Castro</em>.<a class="ref" id="ref8.1" href="#note8.1">1</a>
Despite the counter-evidence provided by Tubino<a class="ref" id="ref8.2" href="#note8.2">2</a> in 1872,
this theory has recently gained so much importance that Don José María Asensio<a class="ref" id="ref8.3" href="#note8.3">3</a>
in 1901 tried to support it with new evidence. From time to time, therefore, the Aliaga authorship
is presented as completely certain.<a class="ref" id="ref8.4" href="#note8.4">4</a> Its supporters
have included La Barrera<a class="ref" id="ref8.5" href="#note8.5">5</a> and
Don Cayetano Rosell.<a class="ref" id="ref8.6" href="#note8.6">6</a>
The reason for Adolfo de Castro’s hypothesis was the following poem
by the Conde de Villamediana<a class="ref" id="ref8.7" href="#note8.7">7</a>:

<div class="poem">
<i>Sancho Panza, el confesor<br>
Del ya difunto monarca,<br>
Que de la vena del arca<br>
Fué de Osuna sangrador,<br>
El cuchillo de dolor<br>
Lleva á Huete atravesado<br>
<a id="p9"><span class="pagenum">p9</span></a>
Y en tan miserable estado,<br>
Que será, segun he oido,<br>
De inquisidor inquirido,<br>
De confesor confesado.</i>
</div>

<p class="continued">This poem, one of many satirical verses that accompanied
the fall of Aliaga<a class="ref" id="ref9.1" href="#note9.1">1</a>
in 1621, refers to a trial
by the Duke of Osuna, in which Aliaga had rendered services to him
and had been paid for it.<a class="ref" id="ref9.2" href="#note9.2">2</a>
The proponents of the Aliaga theory claim that Aliaga had in fact been
nicknamed “Sancho Panza” since his youth, and see allusions to him in the
above-quoted <i>cuadrillos</i> from the <i>certamen</i> of Zaragoza. The insult
lay in Cervantes’ having given the same nickname to his comic squire.
It is probably more reasonable to assume that Villamediana gave the confessor
Sancho Panza’s name, in ironic reference to the squire’s unselfish
administration of the island of Barataria. Whether Aliaga, who did not leave
his monastery in Zaragoza until 1602, was known to Cervantes during the writing
of Part I it is not possible to determine.
Cervantes did take part in a poetry competition<a class="ref" id="ref9.3" href="#note9.3">3</a>
in Zaragoza in 1595.
However, it is not known whether he was there in person.

<p>As for Aliaga’s being known as a writer, he was credited with a
pseudonymous pamphlet against Quevedo: the <i>Venganza de la lengua
española contra el autor del Cuento de Cuentos, por Don Juan Alonso
Laureles, caballero de hábito y peón de costumbres, aragonés liso y
castellano revuelto</i> (Huesca, 1629).<a class="ref" id="ref9.4" href="#note9.4">4</a>

<p>To the question of stylistic similarities between the <i>Venganza</i>
and Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> I will return later. But Aliaga cannot
have authored the <i>Venganza</i> because this polemic was written in 1628,
while the ex-confessor died in 1626. This dating
<a id="p10"><span class="pagenum">p10</span></a>
is required by the allusions to Quevedo’s <i>Sueños</i> (1627)<a class="ref" id="ref10.1" href="#note10.1">1</a>
and to his <i>Discurso de todos los Diablos</i> (1628).<a class="ref" id="ref10.2" href="#note10.2">2</a>
La Barrera believes that in
<i>D.&nbsp;Q.</i> II.61 he has spotted an allusion to Aliaga (the word <i>aliaga</i> meaning “gorse”).
Finally, Asensio has read an acrostic from the opening words of Avellaneda’s work:
<span class="Av"><i>"El sabio <em>Ali</em>solan, historiador
no menos moderno que verdadero, dice que siendo expelido los moros
<em>aga</em>renos..."</i></span> Above all, the purpose of an acrostic is to catch the reader’s eye;
but this one does not. Finally, what makes Aliaga’s authorship seem completely impossible
is his position. In the years 1609–1613, when a large part of the
royal business rested on his shoulders, he would hardly have had the time
to write a novel. If he had wanted to revenge himself on Cervantes for some insult,
he had other means at his disposal. I think that even this somewhat cursory
examination of Adolfo de Castro’s hypothesis has shown that we cannot identify
Fray Luis Aliaga with the author of the false <i>Quijote</i>.

<p>This hypothesis, in its use of evidence, is somewhat similar to that
put forth by <em>Marcelino Menendez y
Pelayo</em>.<a class="ref" id="ref10.3" href="#note10.3">3</a>
Among the poets mentioned in the Zaragoza <i>certamen</i>, he chose one —
<em>Alonso Lamberto</em> — who suited his purpose in that nothing at all
is known about him. In the letters of the first four words of the book
he made out the name, and he explained the name <i>Solisdán</i> (the sonnet <i>“De Solisdán
á Don Quijote”</i>) as a transposition of <i>Don Alonso.</i>
Groussac<a class="ref" id="ref10.4" href="#note10.4">4</a>
might have been more correct when he saw in <i>Solisdán</i> a near-anagram
of <i>Lasindo</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref10.5" href="#note10.5">5</a>
Any close relationship between Lamberto and Lope de Vega is just as
unproven as his kinship with Don Martín Lamberto Iñiguez,
which incidentally would not be sufficient to characterize him as a
professional writer.

<p>Menendez y Pelayo considers it not impossible that the
<a id="p11"><span class="pagenum">p11</span></a>
above-mentioned <i>Venganza de la lengua española</i> too
comes from Alonso Lamberto. One would have first to establish
whether there really exist stylistic similarities<a class="ref" id="ref11.1" href="#note11.1">1</a>
between Laureles and Avellaneda. The <i>Venganza</i>
is a product of the opposition to Quevedo that emerged from
strict religious circles and which produced even more
polemics<a class="ref" id="ref11.2" href="#note11.2">2</a>
against him. The polemic against Quevedo’s critical aspirations
in the <i>Cuento de Cuentos</i> (1626) — which reopened the battle against
colloquial expression in Spanish that the author had
with the <i>Pregmática</i> (1600)<a class="ref" id="ref11.3" href="#note11.3">3</a>
begun and in the <i>Visita de los chistes</i> continued — serves the pamphleteer
only as the pretext for other accusations. In philological terms,
we may admit after all that he was right. But he spends little time on
these questions, and soon, in accordance with his actual intention,
he moves on to the key point of his opposition by pointing out the
moral<a class="ref" id="ref11.4" href="#note11.4">4</a>
and religious danger inherent in Quevedo’s works due to their mockery of the
clergy.<a class="ref" id="ref11.5" href="#note11.5">5</a>
The whole cleverly calculated nature of his polemic,
in which he repeatedly returns to the fact that at root he
wishes the author well and advises him to be a little more cautious
and imitate Lope de Vega, is fundamentally different from Avellaneda’s
careless, clumsy attack.
I have not been able to find the alleged similarity
in the style of the two writers, especially as it is not said in what this
<a id="p12"><span class="pagenum">p12</span></a>
similarity actually consists. Moreover, the <i>Venganza</i> has a stylistic peculiarity
that in Avellaneda I did not notice — I mean the playing with words of
similar sound but different meaning.
For example: <i>“me duele su tentada flaqueza, desatentada lengua, y
papeles hechos á tiento de pintor”</i> etc. and <i>“mire que es religioso, y debe
ser sacro lego, pero no sacrilego”</i>. I therefore cannot believe that
the <i>Venganza</i>’s author is identical with the false <i>Quijote</i>’s.

<p>Thus the hypothesis of Menendez y Pelayo (to which he himself attaches little
importance) we must abandon.

<p>An improvement in method is represented by <em>Groussac’s</em><a class="ref" id="ref12.1" href="#note12.1">1</a>
solution to the authorship question. He relies on observations of a
linguistic nature, by which he intends to prove that
Avellaneda and <em>Juan Martí,</em> the author of the false <i>Guzman</i>,
are one and the same. He presents the Aragonisms already cited by Pellicer
and some new examples as Valencianisms and looks for
equivalents in Juan Martí. Pellicer<a class="ref" id="ref12.2" href="#note12.2">2</a> describes the following
expressions as Aragonese: “He (Cervantes) identifies the language (of
Avellaneda) as Aragonese, because sometimes he writes without articles; and
he could have alleged other proofs as numerous as they are convincing,
such as: 1. <i>en salir de la carcel</i>, for <i>en saliendo</i> or <i>habiendo salido</i>;
2. <i>á la que volvió la cabeza</i>, for <i>habiendo vuelto la cabeza</i>;
3. <i>escupe y le pegaré</i>, for <i>le castigaré</i>; 4. <i>hincar carteles</i>,
for <i>fixar</i> or <i>pegar</i>; 5. <i>poner la escudilla en las brasas</i>, for
<i>poner la taza sobre las asquas</i>; 6. <i>el señal</i>, for <i>la señal</i>;
7. <i>menudo</i>, for <i>mondongo</i>;
8. <span class="unclear" title="Pellicer has “malagana”"><i>mala gana</i></span>, for <i>congoja</i>, <i>desmayo,</i> or <i>vaguido</i>;
and 9. <span class="unclear" title="aquel tratarse las personas de impersonál">some
treatment of persons via the impersonal form,</span> as in <i>mire, oyga, perdone.</i>”

<p>The criterion ascribed to Cervantes for Avellaneda’s Aragonese origin loses
a great deal of weight when one considers the cases in which Avellaneda omits
the article: <span class="Av"><i>“ello es verdad
que no todas (las) veces nos salían las aventuras como nosotros
querían”</i></span> and <span class="Av"><i>“con esto hacía toda (la) resistencia que podía para
soltarse.”</i></span> In the Catalan language,<a class="ref" id="ref12.3" href="#note12.3">3</a>
just as in the older Spanish, <i>todo</i> occurs without the article:
<i>“en todas guisas”</i> (<i>Amadis</i>), <i>“porque en invierno
<a id="p13"><span class="pagenum">p13</span></a>
no es menester fresco, y en verano no lo hay todas veces”</i> (Pedro Mejía,
<i>Coloquio del porfiado</i>), <i>“no podían ejecutar las temas de sus locuras
todas veces”</i> (Quevedo, <i>Casa de locos de amor</i>).
[The latter two examples are due to Borao, <a href="https://archive.org/details/diccionariodevoc00borauoft/page/80"><i>op. cit.</i></a>]
Rather than because
of this usage, Cervantes probably arrived at the conclusion that the author
was Aragonese because the book was printed in Tarragona.

<p>Of the other examples given by Pellicer, <i>escudilla,
menudo, pegar, brasas</i> are listed in the Academy’s <i>Diccionario</i> as Castilian.
The impersonal form of address, according to Borao,<a class="ref" id="ref13.1" href="#note13.1">1</a>
is a feature of liturgical language. The following points remain to be dealt with:

<div class="indented-list">
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>en</i> + infinitive, for <i>al</i> + infinitive. Besides Pellicer’s example, we have:
<span class="Av"><i>“y la primera cosa que hizo en despertar fué preguntar á Sancho por
la reina Cenobia”</i></span> (86b). Otherwise we invariably find <i>al</i>
(5a, 11b, 22b,
27b, 82b, etc.). In the false <i>Guzman</i> we observe the same
oscillation between <i>en</i> and <i>al</i>. Morel-Fatio suggests that the two cases
of <i>en</i>, compared to the many cases of <i>al</i>, in Avellaneda
could be attributed to the Aragonese printer.

<p>2.&nbsp; <i>á la que ...</i> is, on the other hand, a peculiarity that I have found
in no other writer of that period. It is an ellipsis for <i>a la hora que</i>.
Whether in Catalan any similar construction exists, I do not know. The example
from Juan Martí
cited by Groussac, <i>“á cuatro que le refieren”</i> etc.
(<i>Guzman</i> <a href="https://archive.org/details/bibliotecadeaut03conggoog/page/364">I.1</a>),
does not belong here.

<p>3.&nbsp; <i>señal</i> as masculine is found only once in Avellaneda and is probably
a Catalanism (<i>lo senyal</i>).<a class="ref" id="ref13.2" href="#note13.2">2</a>
Elsewhere Avellaneda writes <span class="Av"><i>“la señal acostumbrada”</i></span> (60a),
<span class="Av"><i>“me hize esta señal en el rostro”</i></span> (69b),
<span class="Av"><i>“con una señal de una
espada de fuego ... otra señal parda de color de acero”</i></span> (26b), etc.
Never in Juan Martí.

<p>4.&nbsp; <i>mala gana</i> <span class="long">=</span> “malaise” is a Catalanism: once in Avellaneda
(97a) and twice in Juan Martí (373b and 376b).
</div>

<p>Groussac enriches Pellicer’s list with several more:
<i>zorriar</i>, <i>buen recado</i> (<i>bastante</i>), <i>repostona</i>, <i>otorgar</i> (<i>confesar</i>), <i>aun</i> (<i>así</i>),
<i>aunque</i> (<i>puesto que</i>), <i>hendo</i> (<i>haciendo</i>), <i>repapo</i>, <i>pedir de</i> (<i>preguntar por</i>),
<i>partera</i> (<i>parida</i>).

<div class="indented-list">
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>zorriar</i> <span class="long">=</span> <i>zurriar</i> (the choice of <i>o</i> or <i>u</i> is unimportant)
is Castilian, and is also found in Quevedo. I have not found it in any Catalan dictionary. Never in Juan Martí.

<p>2.&nbsp; <i>repostón, — a</i> (8a, 65a, 83b, 110b) — Borao writes: “We
<a id="p14"><span class="pagenum">p14</span></a>
have heard this word many times, used today without any class distinction.” But I have
not found it in any Catalan dictionary.

<p>The formation is given easily from <i>repuesto</i> + suffix <i>-ón</i>.

<p>2. <i>á buen recado</i> in fact does not mean <i>bastante</i>. <span class="Av"><i>“¡Buen recado
se tiene!”</i></span> (111a) means
<span class="unclear" title="Der ist unter sicherm Verschluss.">“It’s well locked up.”</span>
And it is unobjectionable as Castilian.

<p>3.&nbsp; <i>otorgar</i>, <i>aun</i>, <i>aunque</i> in the senses given by Groussac
cannot be found in Avellaneda.

<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Hendo</i> and <i>her</i> belong to the familiar language of all Spain, and are also found in Cervantes.

<p>5.&nbsp; <i>repapo</i>: <span class="Av"><i>“Sancho durmió aquella noche muy de repapo”</i></span> (15a).
Borao cites it, but knows no other instances. If we do not consider it a neologism from
<i>papo</i> (“to eat” <span class="long">=</span> <i>henchir lo papo</i>, Catalan <i>omplir lo
pap</i>, or
<i>de referto papo</i>), then we could place it under Catalan <i>repaparse</i> <span class="long">=</span>
<i>repantigarse</i>. Either way, it would be a Catalanism.

<p>6.&nbsp; <i>pedir de</i> is not found in Avellaneda; but we often find
<i>preguntar por</i> (13b, 25b, 41b, 43b, 46a, etc.).
Even if the former had occurred, it still would be no Catalanism.<a class="ref" id="ref14.1" href="#note14.1">1</a>

<p>7.&nbsp; <i>partera</i> for <i>partida</i>: Catalanism. “Said of a female that has not long before
given birth”
(<a href="https://archive.org/details/diccionaridelal01estegoog/page/n353">Labèrnia y Esteller</a>).

<p>8.&nbsp; <i>henchir</i> <span class="long">=</span> <i>llenar</i> is Castilian (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qKm8nzelynUC&pg=PA466">Covarrubias</a>).

<p>9.&nbsp; <i>buena voya</i>: Italian loanword (<i>buona voglia</i> <span class="long">=</span>
one who rows in a galley of his own free will).
</div>

<p>So there remain from Catalan only <i>partera</i>, <i>mala gana</i>, and (perhaps)
<i>repapo</i>. It is not impossible that Avellaneda was, after all, Aragonese.
It merely seems to me that the above-mentioned peculiarities are useless in proving
his identity.

<p>Contrariwise, Avellaneda has a preference for certain phrases
that we do not find in Juan Martí; e.g. <span class="Av"><i>ello es verdad</i></span>,
<span class="Av"><i>no entender la música</i></span>,
<span class="Av"><i>hacer pelillos á la mar</i></span>, etc. Particularly
characteristic, as Morel-Fatio has noted, is his extensive use
of the preposition <i>tras</i>. The proportions in which each writer used
this preposition are as follows (but note that the false <i>Guzman</i>
is one-third shorter than the <i>Don Quijote</i>):

<center>
<a id="p14"><span class="pagenum">p14</span></a>

</center>

<p>On the other hand, Juan Martí has a particular fondness for the formula
<i>aunque — pero</i> (resp. <i>empero</i>), which he uses 24 times compared to none
in Avellaneda. E.g. <i>“Y <b>aunque</b> yo tampoco miraba por el mío</i> (provecho),
<i><b>pero</b> tenía hecha costumbre de casa de monseñor.”</i>

<p>Avellaneda also prefers to connect sentences using a demonstrative; not
only <i>tras esto</i> but <i>con esto</i>, <i>en esto</i>, <i>oyendo esto</i>,
<i>con esta quimera</i>, etc. Any stylistic similarity between these two writers
is, consequently, out of the question.

<p>But, as Groussac observes, we must not place too much confidence
in a linguistic comparison, since one’s style might change considerably
over the span of ten years. He therefore seeks
to demonstrate that the same personality is reflected in both works.
Certain quotations seem to him to be based on the same education.
But I have the impression that Juan Martí in his profuse quotations
shows more erudition than Avellaneda
with his few scraps of Latin, which are not even always correct
(<span class="Av"><i>“parcere prostratis docuit nobis</i></span> (should be <i>nos</i>)
<span class="Av"><i>ira leonis”</i></span> [Cap. III];
the phrase <span class="Av"><i>“est deus in nobis”</i></span><a class="ref" id="ref15.1" href="#note15.1">1</a> [Cap. XXV]
is not from Horace but from Ovid).

The two mentions of Cenobia in <i>Guzman</i> are said to
allude to the Cenobia of <i>Don Quijote</i>; a single mention of
Lope de Vega, to Avellaneda’s friendship with him; even <i>Guzman</i>’s detailed
observations on prison and theater life, to
Avellaneda’s sparse judgments on the same subjects. The knowledge
of secular and canon law that Avellaneda, like Juan Martí,
is supposed to possess is limited to a single mention of the <i>bula de
composición</i> [Cap. XXVII]. The false <i>Guzman</i> is pervaded by a spirit wholly
different from that of the false <i>Quijote</i>. Nothing lies further from Avellaneda
than the love of philosophizing and moralizing which often leads Juan Martí
<a id="p16"><span class="pagenum">p16</span></a>
to page-long reflections on all kinds of things. Avellaneda
is terser in his depictions and more familiar in his expressions. In short,
one will find more differences than similarities between the two.
We must thus condemn also Groussac’s hypothesis; so we arrive at
our last-to-be-discussed attempt to solve the authorship question.

<p>Avellaneda says in his Prologue that he wants to revenge the insults given
by Cervantes to Lope de Vega. Could it be, behind the pseudonym,
<em>Lope de Vega</em> himself? Given the rivalry between the two poets,
which impelled each to compete in the other’s field — Lope de Vega
in prose, Cervantes in comedy — the idea seems obvious.
But there is much to be said from the outset against this hypothesis,
which was put forth by <em>Maínez</em>.<a class="ref" id="ref16.1" href="#note16.1">1</a>
Firstly, the relationship between the two poets,
which was extremely tense when the first part of <i>Don Quijote</i>
was published, must have improved somewhat over time. For in
1612 we find both of them in the Academia Selvaje. Lope de Vega
himself tells us in a letter to the Duke of Sessa that at one meeting
of the Academia, in order to read a poem, he borrowed from Cervantes
a pair of glasses which “looked like a couple of badly made
fried eggs.”<a class="ref" id="ref16.2" href="#note16.2">2</a>
In their later works, both speak only in a tone of the greatest respect
of each other. Secondly, there is not the slightest similarity
between the style of Lope and that of Avellaneda,
although Maínez claims the opposite.<a class="ref" id="ref16.3" href="#note16.3">3</a>
I dare not judge this point more aptly than did Menendez y Pelayo:
“That Lope is the author of Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i>
is highly improbable. The characteristic style of
this novel bears no resemblance to Lope’s manner as a writer of prose.
It resembles not the poetic and Latinized prose of the <i>Arcadia</i>
and <i>Peregrino en su patria</i>; nor the unforced and elegant
historical prose of the <i>Triunfo de la fé en los reinos del Japón</i>; nor
again the pleasant, natural, expressive, and graceful diction
of many scenes of the <i>Dorotea</i>, which sometimes rivals
<a id="p17"><span class="pagenum">p17</span></a>
the <i>Celestina</i>; nor, finally, the buffoonish wit of the private letters,
which, although they do little honor to their author, are of great value
in judging his spirit and his humor. But even in this
private correspondence, where the great poet often gracelessly transgresses
all bounds, there is nothing that can compare to the indecent crudeness
of Avellaneda. Whenever Lope writes for the public he proceeds,
in drawing pictures of bad morals — the which could not be omitted from his
immense theater, if it were really to be a perfect depiction of the human comedy —
with a certain economy and good taste never displayed by Avellaneda.
As in the <i>Dorotea</i> itself, so in the <i>Ansuelo de Feniza</i>, the <i>Rufián Castrucho</i>,
the <i>Arsenal de Sevilla</i>. Never, not even in the loosest sense,
can the noble muse of Lope and Tirso be compared with the brutal realism of
Avellaneda, which is to him, among all the writers of that century, unique.”

<p>Here I intend to close my discussion of the authorship question,
without being able to agree in good conscience with any of the
solutions put forth so far. Nor am I in a position to solve
the riddle in a new way, since the names of the available
novelists of that time have already been exhausted. Unless new
evidence is added, it will hardly be possible to give a satisfactory
answer to the authorship question. Nonetheless I do not believe
that the last word has been spoken about Avellaneda.
For whenever anyone speaks of the immortal work of Cervantes,
his bold imitator will also be mentioned — with contempt.
He will continue to play his role as the Ahasuerus of literary history,
and may yet turn up several more times under new names.

<p>Even if our consideration of the authorship question has yielded
no definite reward, it has brought us one benefit, at least: It has
led us to form a judgment of the style and personality of the author.
This will be of particular use to us as we now proceed to examine
the work itself.

<p>
<center><h3-em>3. Avellaneda’s Intentions.
The Influence of his Work<br>
on the Second Part of Cervantes’ <i>Don Quijote</i>.</h3-em></center>

<p>When Cervantes announced in the Prologue to his <i>Novelas exemplares</i>
that the second part of his <i>Don Quijote</i>
<a id="p18"><span class="pagenum">p18</span></a>
was about to be published, his imitator — who evidently knew nothing
about Cervantes’ also writing a second part — had almost completed
his sequel. It is therefore understandable that Cervantes’ announcement
caused him great agitation. For the pecuniary gain with which
he was no doubt initially concerned was thereby
endangered. He then hit upon the device of giving his book
traction by means of a Prologue full of dark allusions and brazen attacks
on Cervantes. That it was not Avellaneda’s original intention
in his book to offend Cervantes personally
seems to me clear from the fact that the
work itself lacks personal allusions<a class="ref" id="ref18.1" href="#note18.1">1</a>
of any kind.

<p>Cervantes was deeply hurt by the insults contained in Avellaneda’s Prologue
and responded with more passion than needed. He felt most hurt
by Avellaneda’s mockery of his age and his one-armedness.
For he had lost his arm in an honourable battle,
and the experience of his age could only be of use to his books.
Cervantes was just writing the 59th chapter of his second part
when he became aware of the apocryphal <i>Don Quijote</i>.
From this chapter on he criticises it continuously. However, he did
not here target the weakest points of the book.

<p>If Avellaneda calls Sancho’s wife Mari-Gutierrez,
Cervantes himself is to blame. He continually fiddles with the
name: sometimes he calls her Mari-Gutierrez, sometimes Juana Gutierrez,
and only in the second part Teresa Panza. He is also to blame when
Avellaneda portrays Sancho as gluttonous.<a class="ref" id="ref18.2" href="#note18.2">2</a>
This merely reiterates a characteristic of Sancho that is briefly
mentioned in Cervantes’ Part I. Incidentally, at Camacho’s wedding (II.21),
Sancho displays a gluttony that would do Avellaneda’s Sancho credit.
But Cervantes is absolutely right when he accuses the book of obscenity.

<p>The false <i>Quijote</i> was not without influence on the final chapters
of the real <i>Don Quijote</i>. Since Avellaneda leads his hero,
following a hint given by Cervantes in the last chapter of Part I,
<a id="p19"><span class="pagenum">p19</span></a>
to Zaragoza, the poet had to deviate from his original plan
and send his knight to Barcelona instead.

<p>The chapters that follow are not up to par with the rest.
One can see the anger and resentment that Cervantes felt after
the blatant plagiarism that was committed against him. The depiction
of the events in Barcelona is dull and colorless. Don Quixote’s madness
rarely plays a role. On the whole, he seems less crazy than the
people who want to make fun of him. The narrative’s faster pace
resumes only when the <i>deus ex machina</i>
Sansón Carrasco puts an end to Don Quixote’s career as a
knight errant. The original plot comes again into focus,
and the action moves quickly and logically towards its end.

<p>Cervantes wants us to believe that he has not read his rival’s book,
but some perhaps unintentional echoes of its wording
prove the opposite. Compare the following passages:

<center>
<table class="table2">
<tr><th>Avellaneda</th><th>Cervantes</th></tr>
<tr><td>
Cap. IV: <span class="Av"><i>“.... nos están aguardando
con una muy gentil olla de vaca,
tocino, carneros, nabos y berzas,

[“They are awaiting us with a very fine stew of
beef, bacon, veal, turnips, and cabbage, which is
calling out, eat me! eat me!”]
</td><td>
II.59: <span class="Cerv"><i>“Señor huesped, dijo el ventero,

[“Sir guest, said the innkeeper, what I really and truly
do have is two cows’ heels just like calves’ feet,

en el seno con intención de guardarlas

[“four pieces of <i>manjar blanco</i> [creamed chicken breasts] ...

[“We’ve heard here, good Sancho, that you are so fond of
<i>manjar blanco</i> and <i>albondiguillas</i>
that if any are left over you’ll save them
in your bosom for another day.”]
</td></tr><tr><td>
Cap. XII: Don Carlos asks Sancho if he
can dance [<i>dar algunas vueltas</i>, like the
youth who is <i>zapateando y volteando</i> before them]:
<span class="Av"><i>“Pardiobre, señor,
que voltearía yo lindisamente,
recostado ahora sobre dos ó tres

[“By Jove, sir, but I’d do a pretty somersault right now

<p>The three <i>tocadores</i> [nightcaps] stolen from Sancho by the robbers (II.67)
<a id="p20"><span class="pagenum">p20</span></a>
recall the <span class="unclear" title="[sic]; Avellaneda has “dos docenas”">three dozen</span>
<i>agujetas</i> [suspenders] that a picaro takes from the squire in Zaragoza (Av. Cap. XI).

<p>The similarities, which can also be found in chapters 1–58 of Part II,
have given rise to various speculations. That
Cervantes imitated Avellaneda in these places seems to me impossible.
On the other hand, Avellaneda’s knowledge of the original Part II
would have left clearer traces. The similarities
of this kind are briefly as follows: The duel between the squires
Sancho and Tomé Cecial (II.14) resembles the planned duel between
Sancho and the black squire (Av. Cap. XXXIII); Don Quixote‘s behavior
during the puppet show (II.26) resembles a corresponding
scene in Avellaneda during a theater performance (Av. Cap. XXVII);
the events at the Duke’s court resemble those in the house of the Archipámpano.
I have not noted any word-for-word similarities.
Ultimately, there is nothing for it but to suppose that
the cited similarities in style are explained by the similarity of
substance.<a class="ref" id="ref20.1" href="#note20.1">1</a>

<p>
<center><h3-em>4. Avellaneda’s Work.</h3-em></center>

<p>Much more striking than the above-discussed echoes of Avellaneda in
Cervantes are (naturally) the relationships between the false
<i>Quijote</i> and Part I. The author was careful to avoid
coincidences of wording, as he lived in a literary-minded
age that would have taken offense at that kind of plagiarism.
Avellaneda prefers to imitate situations of coarse comedy.
Thus he has carefully scraped together all the grime of Part I
and, with the obscene products of his own imagination, augmented it.

<p>The exposition of the sequel is given by the end of the first part.
Don Quixote, thanks to the good care of his housekeeper
and his niece, is once more completely sane. He reads
edifying books (Villegas’ <i>Flos Sanctorum</i>,
Fray Luis de Granada’s <i>Guía de pecadores</i>,
and the “Evangelios y Epístolas de todo el año en vulgar”)
and diligently attends Mass. Then
Sancho, by the mention of a book of knightly romance, awakens in him
<a id="p21"><span class="pagenum">p21</span></a>
the old madness, which fully emerges after some nobles spend the night
in the village on their way to the tournaments in Zaragoza.
One of them, Don Alvaro Tarfé, leaves with Don
Quixote a suit of Milanese armor, which he immediately
appropriates, calling it a gift from the wise Alquife. One fine morning,
he leaves the village with Sancho, intending to go to the tournaments
in Zaragoza. At the first inn<a class="ref" id="ref21.1" href="#note21.1">1</a>
everything occurs according to the pattern of Part I: This inn has its
own Maritornes;<a class="ref" id="ref21.2" href="#note21.2">2</a>
Don Quixote takes her for a captured princess and wants to return her
to her own kingdom;<a class="ref" id="ref21.3" href="#note21.3">3</a>
Don Quixote as he leaves refuses to pay.<a class="ref" id="ref21.4" href="#note21.4">4</a>
There is no lack of echoes in the wording, e.g.:

<center>
<table class="table2">
<tr><th>Avellaneda</th><th>Cervantes</th>

Cap. V: <span class="Av"><i>“Señor caballero, aqui
no habemos menester cosa alguna,

save that your honor or this peasant you have

<p>After six days the two travelers arrive at Ariza,
where Don Quixote has a new device painted on his shield. Because
he has received from Dulcinea an unkind reply to a
letter<a class="ref" id="ref21.5" href="#note21.5">5</a>
he wrote, he decides to give up his love for her and to
call himself the <span class="Av"><i>Caballero desamorado</i></span> [“Loveless Knight”].
He has an adventure with a melon farmer, whom he calls sometimes
“Orlando furioso,”<a class="ref" id="ref21.6" href="#note21.6">6</a>
sometimes Aglante, sometimes Bellido de Olfos. The knight and Sancho
are beaten and their mounts are taken.<a class="ref" id="ref21.7" href="#note21.7">7</a>
The priest of Ateca hosts them for eight days and, when they leave,
advises Don Quixote in the same way as the canon of Toledo (I.48)
about the mendacity of chivalric tales. Don Quixote goes
<a id="p22"><span class="pagenum">p22</span></a>
to Zaragoza, where he tries to free a prisoner, following the example
of the freeing of the galley slaves (I.22). He then attacks a
notary, who saves himself from the thrust in the same way
as the barber (I.21), namely by sliding backwards off his donkey.
The knight is saved from the threat of flagellation only by the
intervention of Don Alvaro Tarfé, who leads him to his
house.<a class="ref" id="ref22.1" href="#note22.1">1</a>
From here on, the author relies on his own invention.
As the tournament is already over, Don Quixote takes part in a
ring-jousting contest: <span class="Av">“It is not unusual
on such festive occasions for the knights to bring lunatics into the
plaza, dressed up and adorned, wearing fanciful headdresses, and have
them do tricks, tilt, joust, and carry off prizes, as has been seen sometimes
in big cities and in Zaragoza itself”</span> (Cap. XI).
At the house of the referee, Don Carlos, where
they eat that evening, Don Quixote receives the challenge of
Bramidán de Tajayunque (<span class="long">=</span> Anvil-Cleaver), King of Cyprus,
a giant carnival figure carried on the shoulders of the host’s secretary.
The following night, the knight dreams that Bramidán has broken in
and is trying to kill the entire household.
In his delusion he pummels Sancho and the
servants,<a class="ref" id="ref22.2" href="#note22.2">2</a> until Don
Alvaro calms him. The secretary reappears in the role of the giant’s squire
and summons Don Quixote to a duel in Madrid, where Don
Alvaro and Don Carlos, because of the marriage of the latter’s
sister, also want to go. On the way to Madrid, Don
Quixote makes the acquaintance of a soldier and a hermit, in whose
company he calls again at Mosén Valentin’s in Ateca.

<p>The next day, because of the great heat, they take
a longer rest at a spring and pass the time by telling stories.
The soldier tells the novel of <i>El rico desesperado</i>, the
hermit the <i>Cuento de los felices amantes</i>, Sancho a story
<a id="p23"><span class="pagenum">p23</span></a>
— the <i>Cuento de nunca acabar</i><a class="ref" id="ref23.1" href="#note23.1">1</a> —
which is identical to the one recorded in I.20 except
that here it is geese (there, sheep) that have to cross the river.
The next adventure is a clumsy travesty of the
Dorotea episode. In a forest they discover, bound to a tree and howling,
a dirty, ugly woman of about fifty: <i>Barbara
la de la cuchillada</i>, a cook from Alcalá de Henares. She was
lured into the forest and robbed by a student who had promised
to marry her.

<p>Don Quixote dubs her Zenobia, Queen of the Amazons, and puts
himself in her service. Her ugliness does not bother him. She is enchanted.
This unsavory woman — a fair substitute for Dulcinea —
accompanies the knight on his further journeys and sullies
his ideal aspirations with her filthy presence. This part
and everything that follows until the end are decidedly the worst
parts of the book: tedious because of the constant repetition of the same motifs,
brawls, and ridicule of the knight; and repulsive because of
the lewd situations brought about by the presence of Barbara, who is basically
a cunning <i>alcahueta</i> <nobr>[<span class="long">=</span> bawd].</nobr>

<p>Don Quixote makes crazy speeches;
<span class="unclear" title="lässt Kartelle anheften">a mob forms;</span>
Sancho is imprisoned, teased by some picaros in the jailhouse, and
then released again. Everywhere the two of them and their female companion
provoke the public’s amusement. On the way to Alcalá, Don Quixote meets
two students who pose riddles for him. At an inn outside Alcalá
he disrupts a performance of Lope de Vega’s comedy <i>El testimonio
vengado</i>.

<p>As a joke, an actor challenges him (just as Don Carlos did) to a
duel, again to take place in Madrid, and gives him the tail-strap
of a mule as a token, which leads to a dispute between Sancho and
the owner.<a class="ref" id="ref23.2" href="#note23.2">2</a>
Upon their arrival in Madrid, Don Quixote
attracts the attention of a high dignitary and is invited
to his house, where he argues with a page and with a
policeman. After making enough fun of the cloverleaf,
they are taken to the house of another dignitary,
who calls himself the <i>Archipámpano</i>. Meanwhile, Don Carlos’ secretary,
<a id="p24"><span class="pagenum">p24</span></a>
who has arrived at the same time as Don Alvaro, appears again as
the giant and is now revealed as the Infanta Burlerina, who has sought out
Don Quixote in this enchanted guise so as to summon him to Toledo to save
her from the Prince of Córdoba. Thus Don Alvaro and Don Carlos
hope to draw the knight to Toledo and put him in a madhouse (<i>casa
del Nuncio</i>) there. Barbara will go to a home for reformed prostitutes (<i>casa
de arrepentidas</i>). Sancho and his wife, whom he
summons by letter, are to stay with the Archipámpano. The author
thus bids him farewell, promising a wonderful story
about his future fate.

<p>Don Quixote is admitted to the madhouse in Toledo. At the book’s end
it is reported that he was released as a cured man and once again set out
on his travels as a knight errant, in the company of a new squire,
who later turned out to be a woman, and in this way
wandered throughout Old Castile, <span class="Av"><i>“llamándose el
Caballero de los Trabajos, los cuales no faltará mejor pluma que los
celebre”</i></span> [“calling himself the Knight of Hardships, the which will
surely not lack a better pen to celebrate
them”].<a class="ref" id="ref24.1" href="#note24.1">1</a>

<p>To draw a conclusion from this analysis: We see that
the author has attempted to continue the first Part in a matching
spirit. But it would really be a miracle if the sequel’s author
were to have penetrated so deeply into the first author’s conception
and identified so well with his spirit as to produce a work
comparable with its model. The designs of
the original work, in the hands of the imitator, will always lose something
of their unspoilt freshness and power. They will be either
washed-out and weak, or overdone and caricatured. Avellaneda’s
manner is to overdo it, picking out individual traits that he
considers to be particularly characteristic of his model and unnaturally
emphasizing them.


<p class="blank">For his Don Quixote character, Avellaneda had to
keep the original idea. Don Quixote remains the “overexcited reader” who
takes the world depicted in his books for real, or at least for
capable of being realized. But much else has been altered in <em>Don Quixote’s
character.</em> The knight’s vanity, which here degenerates into foppishness,
Avellaneda makes downright unpleasant.
Sometimes he calls himself Cid, sometimes Fernán González, sometimes Achilles or
<a id="p25"><span class="pagenum">p25</span></a>
Ferdinand of Aragon. This trait stands out all the more because
the author has neglected to describe another side that
is capable of softening the unsympathetic characteristics of Don Quixote’s character:
his disposition. For we can be truly interested in his hero only so long
as we also feel real sympathy for
him and view his madness compassionately.

<p>Cervantes had already reprimanded Avellaneda for letting his knight
relinquish his love for Dulcinea. He who had taken the most loyal of all
knights errant, Amadis de Gaula, as his model had to
remain true to his lady. His fantasy love life was his
whole happiness, his support, his muse. Cervantes
twice<a class="ref" id="ref25.1" href="#note25.1">1</a>
expresses this thought very beautifully:
<span class="Cerv">“A knight-errant without a lady is like a
tree without leaves, a building without foundation, a shadow without body
to cast it.”</span>

<p>Avellaneda has tried to treat the pathological side in
the same way as Cervantes. In both cases, Don Quixote is
a <i>loco entreverado</i>, “a madman shot through (with sanity).”
Nevertheless, certain differences still appear.
Since we would not get far on this point with purely aesthetic considerations,
I would first like to identify and classify the symptoms of <em>Don Quixote’s
illness</em> with the help of psychological criteria.

<p>The causes of his illness are easy to see. He is
by nature weakly built, poorly nourished, and prone to enthusiasms.
Day and night he reads chivalric romances, so that from so much
reading and so little sleep he eventually goes mad. His brain dries up,
says Cervantes; a modern doctor more learnedly might call it
cerebral atrophy. The poor hidalgo’s idea of reviving
knight-errantry by example is a kind of megalomania.

<p>The symptoms of his illness consist of sensory illusions.
Most of the time he is subject to apperception illusions; that is, to
the kind of false perceptions that arise from actual
sensory impressions distorted by subjective elements from his own
imagination. The inclarity or ambiguity
of perception encourages the emergence of illusions. In
sick or merely psychologically weakened individuals, they take on
<a id="p26"><span class="pagenum">p26</span></a>
the sharpness of real sensory impressions.<a class="ref" id="ref26.1" href="#note26.1">1</a>
The conditions are extremely favorable for the emergence of
distorted perceptions: strong, pleasant stimuli, great vividness
of ideas, and finally the inability to intelligently examine and correct
the material of experience.<a class="ref" id="ref26.2" href="#note26.2">2</a>
These environmentally caused false perceptions are to be sharply distinguished from
hallucinations, i.e. those false perceptions in which an external source of stimulus
is not present at all. A simple resemblance suffices to produce phantasms
that are equivalent to actual sensory
impressions.<a class="ref" id="ref26.3" href="#note26.3">3</a>
False perceptions of this second kind we seldom find in <i>Don Quijote</i>.

<p>In Don Quixote’s case, so as to delineate the individual phases
of the illusion process from onset to conclusion,
I will use the episode of the
rams<a class="ref" id="ref26.4" href="#note26.4">4</a>
as a model example. Since the individual moments, as I will simultaneously
show, recur in the other adventures, they may be considered
typical for the course of an attack.

<div class="indented-list">
<p>1.&nbsp; The <em>illusion-inducing moment:</em> in our case a
cloud of dust that is stirred up by the approaching flock of sheep.
The basin on the barber’s head shines in the sun like
gold. During the adventure with Maritornes it is night. The noise
of the unseen fulling mill, the long arms of the windmill, etc.

<p>2.&nbsp; The <em>resemblance.</em> What is perceived triggers
memories from the reading. An approaching cloud of dust
in the romances usually indicates an approaching army,
princesses seek out knights errant at night, etc.

<p>3.&nbsp; From the mixing of the apperceived and the remembered,
the resulting <em>judgment:</em> There is an approaching army, a princess,
giants, etc.

<p>4.&nbsp; <em>Total illusion.</em> The situation existing only in the illusion
decisively determines the knight’s actions. As can be seen from
Sancho’s behavior, a correction of the mistake would yet be
possible. The illusion, however, has progressed to such a high degree and to
such a clarity that the real state of affairs cannot be recognized.
This is the pathological
<a id="p27"><span class="pagenum">p27</span></a>
symptom per se. Don Quixote rides with lowered lance into the flock of sheep,
attacks the windmill, etc.


<p>5.&nbsp; The <em>dissolution of the illusion</em> usually occurs
violently. Don Quixote is beaten up, falls from his horse, etc.

<p>6.&nbsp; The <em>corollary illusion.</em><a class="ref" id="ref27.1" href="#note27.1">1</a>
He explains the bad outcome of the adventure
according to the sense of his books of chivalry. His horse is to blame for the
misfortune, or there are evil enchanters at work. This is a corollary
that follows directly from the consistent carrying-through of the delusive idea.
</div>

<a id="PsychologicalDevelopment">
<p>Avellaneda does not always succeed in presenting the entire psychological process
with the same consistency as does Cervantes. When Don
Quixote takes an inn for a castle, but in the next moment speaks
of a <span class="Av"><i>“ventero andante”</i></span> [“innkeeper-errant”] (Cap. IV)
or says: <span class="Av"><i>“¡Entramos en la venta!”</i></span> (Cap. XXVI),
this is certainly a mistake on the
author’s part. No trace of realism or psychological grounding is found
in Don Quixote’s behavior during the ring-joust in Zaragoza.
The illusion process is actually carried out in the episode of
the melon farmer, and in the discovery of Barbara. In the former,
the lance serves to induce the illusion; in the latter, a scream from
the bushes.<a class="ref" id="ref27.2" href="#note27.2">2</a>
In both cases we also find the characteristic
corollary illusions. The adventure of the giant Tajayunque is on
a level with the Micomicona episode (I.29), in that these are
artificially created situations that require Don Quixote’s own
belief in giants and in exiled princesses
in need of aid. Dreams are the illusion-inducing moment
in Don Quixote’s nocturnal battle with the supposed giants
(Av. Cap. XIII) and in his attack on the wineskins (I.36).
Real fits of rage of a hallucinatory nature, as occur in
Avellaneda Cap.&nbsp;III and&nbsp;X, cannot be considered an
enrichment of the Don Quixote motif; they arouse rather more
displeasure than amusement. The hidalgo appears clearly
insane. Such a mental state would lead necessarily to the asylum.

Cervantes, in his Part II, takes on the problem differently.
He portrays Don Quixote in a new stage of his illness.
<a id="p28"><span class="pagenum">p28</span></a>
The symptoms of impending recovery become more and more numerous,
the relapses become less frequent, so that his recovery at book’s end
does not come unexpectedly. The individual adventures are
all of a kind requiring only that the knight believe in the possibility
of knight-errantry and in the existence of fabulous creatures.
The hallucinatory element recedes completely into the background. The
knight no longer sees inns as castles; twice this is particularly
emphasized. The adventures approach him in
such a form that they no longer require transformation
by the imagination. Don Quixote’s reactions are,
however, determined by his memories of the chivalric romances.
Into this category fall: the fight with the Knight of the Mirrors; the
encounter with the actors of the <i>Auto de las Cortes de la Muerte</i>;
the brilliant episode of the lion; and finally all the adventures
orchestrated by the Duke and Duchess. The corollary illusion is in most cases
unneeded. In the episode of the puppet show, Don Quixote is subject
only to that theatrical
illusion<a class="ref" id="ref28.1" href="#note28.1">1</a>
which sometimes occurs even in normal men.
It is significant, too, that he does not look for an excuse in his usual way,
but rather acknowledges his mistake and compensates the puppeteer.
The experience in the cave of Montesinos is a dream,
and therefore does not fall into the class of sensory illusions. Don Quixote
himself later begins to doubt the reality of what he dreamed.

<p>In summary, the hidalgo is in Cervantes’ Part&nbsp;II interpreted in a
wholly new mode. Still, I cannot put this volume on an aesthetic level
with Part&nbsp;I. Goethe seems to me to have spoken rightly when he said: “So long
as the hero has his illusions, he is romantic; so soon as he is merely teased
and mystified, real interest ceases.”<a class="ref" id="ref28.2" href="#note28.2">2</a>

<p>Avellaneda, on the other hand, one could accuse of
<span class="unclear" title="den übernommenen Typus nicht erfolgreich variiert habe">having
unsuccessfully altered his adopted character</span>.

<p>Avellaneda’s <em>Sancho</em>, who aroused Lesage’s admiration,
<a id="p29"><span class="pagenum">p29</span></a>
brings little new beyond his role model. I find also that he lacks
Sancho’s likeable traits: his kindheartedness and his loyalty.

Of the new characters introduced by Avellaneda, only one
is of importance. Dorothea, in Part I, corresponds in Avellaneda’s
<i>Don Quijote</i> to Barbara, an ugly old woman who uses her
job as a tripe-seller as a pretext for all kinds of dishonest business.
The relationship with Celestina is obvious. She
is the clever procuress who, from the Middle Latin <i>Pamphilus de
amore</i> to the brilliant treatment she received from Juan Ruíz
as Trotaconventos and from Fernando de Rojas as Celestina, has
earned her place in the literature of Spain. If of
Barbara it is reported that her nickname in Alcalá
was <i>“la de la cuchillada”</i> because of a scar on her
cheek, we learn the same of her famous predecessor: <i>“aquella
vieja de la cuchillada, que solía biuir en las tenerías, á la cuesta del río”</i>
[“that old woman with the scar who used to live among the tanneries down by the
river”].<a class="ref" id="ref29.1" href="#note29.1">1</a>
The <i>persignum crucis</i> has its counterpart in the <i>“fermosa con aquel su
Dios os salve que traviessa la media cara”</i> [“beautiful one with that
God-save-you across the middle of the
face”].<a class="ref" id="ref29.2" href="#note29.2">2</a>
Barbara is also said to have the same skills as Celestina. In one thing
they differ: Barbara is base and mean. She lacks that
genius in vice that makes Celestina somewhat demonic, and that
knowledge of the weaknesses of the human soul that gives her mastery
of the situation. That Avellaneda gives her the name of the Empress of
Palmyra, Zenobia,<a class="ref" id="ref29.3" href="#note29.3">3</a>
and makes her the Queen of the Amazons, does not seem to me to be founded
in any book of chivalry. Still, Zenobia is mentioned in <i>Orlando
Furioso</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref29.4" href="#note29.4">4</a>
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>’s hag Gabrina<a class="ref" id="ref29.5" href="#note29.5">5</a>
also bears some resemblance to Barbara.

<p>Avellaneda’s introduction of this character, as
we have seen already above, has no aesthetic benefit.


<p class="blank">As he explains in the preface, Avellaneda’s intention too
is to eliminate those corrupting books of chivalry. Cervantes
satirizes the chivalric stories by portraying a knight who takes the
<a id="p30"><span class="pagenum">p30</span></a>
chivalric stories for histories and wants to realize their contents,
because he believes that the age in which he lives, compared to the world
of those books, itself represents corruption. The absurdity of this undertaking,
which continually founders in its contact with everyday life, is intended
to reveal the complete untruthfulness of the chivalric books. The individual episodes are
parodies of similar situations in the ridiculed books. Every aspect
is translated to a lower sphere. It is not knights against whom the
hidalgo fights, but muleteers; not giants, but windmills;
not entire hosts, but flocks of sheep. A <em>satire</em> that makes use of
such methods is better called <i>burlesque</i> than <i>grotesque</i>, as
Schneegans<a class="ref" id="ref30.1" href="#note30.1">1</a> does,
if we consider the essential characteristic of the grotesque
to be immoderate exaggeration, but of the burlesque to be the mixture of
the dignified with the trivial.

<p>To further delimit Cervantes’ use of satire, we might compare
his work to the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>.

<p>“The means of comic representation lies, for Ariosto, in the
naturalness and realism of his representation, even if he applies it to
the most wonderful and fantastic things.”<a class="ref" id="ref30.2" href="#note30.2">2</a>
He has no interest in polemicizing against the chivalric literature.
He delights in the fabulous inventions of the troubadours’ tales and
presents them with a skepticism characteristic of the Renaissance. Cervantes,
on the other hand, does not want to emphasize the aesthetic inferiority of chivalric books
so much as the harm they can do with their one-sided encouragement of fantasy life.
This didactic trait is the most important feature
that separates the satirical approach from the ironic.

<p>Satire measures its object against some ideal, some Should-Be, so that
the situations with which it deals appear petty, miserable, even harmful.
Although the satirical and the comical are related
in that both aim to reduce their object to absurdity,
one cannot consider them identical. Satire, in pursuing
its didactic, ethical, or frivolous aims, employs
comedy as merely its expressive mode.

<p>Humor, in the context of satire, has another special task.
It aims to counteract satire’s corrosive tendencies through its
optimistic and conciliatory substance.

<p>The means and the end of satire were, for Avellaneda, given quantities.
The only question is whether he has hit the mark set by Cervantes.
<a id="p31"><span class="pagenum">p31</span></a>
Of course, we need consider this question only in respect to the
situations he himself invented.

<p>His knight travels through all sorts of villages and towns,
<span class="unclear" title="”heftet Kartelle“: forms alliances? draws crowds?">gains companions</span>,
and challenges to combat the local nobility —
although these are by no means the main activities of the novels’ heroes.
It is more in the spirit of the chivalric books when Avellaneda gets his Don Quixote
involved in an adventure via a shout from the bushes,
or has a giant challenge him to a duel.
The ring-joust in Zaragoza acts rather to show how the gory tournaments of
olden times had become a mere game, than to satirize
the combats depicted in the stories.

<p>Cervantes also pokes fun at the form of the knightly tales,
by imitating the eccentric style that is typical of most novels of this kind
(apart from the first books of <i>Amadis</i>, which are written in exemplary prose).
In form he does not exaggerate. Even the most chivalresque gibberish of
Don Quixote fails to approach some of the stylistic feats
of Feliciano de Silva [author of the <i>Florisel de Niquea</i> and others].
The comic effect comes merely from the juxtaposition
of two different styles. Since the caricature is missing, this
technique is better classified as irony; in Cervantes the ironic
and the satirical forms of humor are commingled without clear distinction.

<p>Avellaneda has used the same device with skill,
but only when Don Quixote speaks. Otherwise he does not stray from
the simple narrative tone. Of those
preludes<a class="ref" id="ref31.1" href="#note31.1">1</a>
that Cervantes, following the example of the chivalric romances (namely the
<i>Caballero del Febo</i> [Phoebus Knight]), uses as an introduction to individual episodes and
chapters, and which often give a pompous description of the
sunrise, we have in Avellaneda only a poor copy:
<span class="Av"><i>“Tres horas antes que el rojo Apolo esparciese sus rayos
sobre la tierra, salieron de su lugar”</i></span> (Cap. IV). Otherwise the chapters
flow into one another without noticeable introduction or conclusion. Nowhere
are there any personal reflections by the author, remarks by the
chronicler, or any direct address to the reader. With this
objectivity the false <i>Quijote</i> stands quite alone in that era’s
literature, in which everywhere the personality of the author —
in the first person or in the guise of a chronicler — shines through.

<p>The direct polemic against the books of chivalry, which Cervantes
<a id="p32"><span class="pagenum">p32</span></a>
uses so skilfully in the <i>escrutinio</i> (I.6), is nowhere used
by Avellaneda. He is content to call the novels of chivalry
<span class="Av">“lying”</span> and <span class="Av">“corrupting.”</span>

<p>To the level of social satire — which Cervantes employs
quite casually and yet which grants his book a universal
meaning<a class="ref" id="ref32.1" href="#note32.1">1</a> —
Avellaneda is unable to rise. However, he does not omit individual
remarks of satirical import. On the model
of the picaresque novel, he dwells on the poor quality
of the inns’ food (Cap. V and XXVII) and on
the violent nature of the students in Alcalá (Cap. XXVIII). Finally,
Sancho’s remarks on the theme of <span class="Av"><i>“la vida de
palacio es vida bestial”</i></span> (Cap. XXXV) also belong under this heading.

<p>I have already indicated that there is a fundamental difference
between satire and comedy in the narrow sense. Namely, whereas
comedy arises when two sets of ideas, initially distinct
in our minds, are suddenly and unexpectedly juxtaposed in some
new relationship,
satire deals with the conflict between an object with an ostensible claim
on our esteem and an ideal that is proper to the poet. The
destruction of the ostensibly valuable through the perspective of
the satirist — which by empathy we make our own perspective —
results in a mix of pleasant and unpleasant feelings similar
to those resulting from the same process in comedy. This effect will be
all the greater if the viewpoints presented by the satirist
are new to us.

<p>So it is that a later era can never achieve full understanding
of a satire. On the one hand, it lacks knowledge and
appreciation of the satirized subject, and on the other hand, it lacks
the dispassion of the contemporary reader. Modern man will hardly
receive the special satire of the <i>Don Quijote</i> with the same
conflicting feelings as did his contemporaries. For him, the book
will be primarily a work of humor. From this shift in perspective
the work’s purely aesthetic effect can only benefit.

<p>The knight’s striving to do things that suit neither his
abilities nor his circumstances must, in its certain failure,
<a id="p33"><span class="pagenum">p33</span></a>
bring about a number of purely comic situations.<a class="ref" id="ref33.1" href="#note33.1">1</a>
The situation is different when the comedy stems from artificially created
situations, the success of which is predicated on his foolishness.
This creates a peculiar kind of comedy: “the farcical [<i>das Possenhafte</i>].”<a class="ref" id="ref33.2" href="#note33.2">2</a>
It is somewhat deliberate, manufactured, something that gambles
on the intellectual weakness of the one it wants to portray in a comic light.
The aim of the person being mocked to comprehend something that he cannot comprehend
increases the comic effect. If Cervantes in his
Part II gives preference to the farcical, the reason for this lies
in the psychological development of his hero.<a class="ref" id="ref33.3" href="#note33.3">3</a>
Comic literature in Spain before Cervantes — stage comedies, <i>entremeses</i>, picaresque
novels — partakes almost exclusively of the farcical.
Cunning, which triumphs over stupidity, gullibility, and good nature,
is everywhere the main theme.

<p>Avellaneda works with the same material as Cervantes. The almost
logical execution of the illusion mechanism had necessarily — in
conjunction with the parodistic imitation of situations from the
books of chivalry (the part of the comedy linked to satire) —
to produce the same comic effects.

<p>The comedy of <i>Don Quijote</i> is essentially based on the
self-deception<a class="ref" id="ref33.4" href="#note33.4">4</a>
in which the hero is caught. This
self-deception is of a twofold nature: firstly the illusion
resulting from his mental state, and secondly his mistaken belief that the means
at his disposal are sufficient for his purposes. The second type — although
dependent on the first, since the knight believes himself
to be strong and his weapons to be keen only by the power of his
illusion — is nonetheless significant
to the comic effect. For if the hero were strong and well
equipped, his delusion would probably appear more tragic than
comic. In addition to the comedy of self-deception, there is
also the comedy of external appearance. If modern man —
<a id="p34"><span class="pagenum">p34</span></a>
who is accustomed to putting mental injuries on a par with physical
ones and therefore for the comedy that can arise from them
has less appreciation than the naïve man — feels when reading <i>Don
Quijote</i> no displeasure at the fact that a poor sick
man is made the butt of the joke, it is simply because
the comic effect of the disproportion between means and ends
and the comic effect of external appearances cheat him out of
such humane reactions. If when reading
Avellaneda’s book we are more likely to feel a sense of disgust at
the knight’s foolishness, this is at least due to a lack
of variation between the comedy of illusion and the comedy of appearances.
Avellaneda rarely succeeds in painting a vivid picture
of the external appearance of the “Knight of the Sorry Figure.” Much
more significant than this difference between the two works —
Cervantes’ and Avellaneda’s — is another: the real <i>Don
Quijote</i> is grounded in a truly humorous worldview.

<p>According to Eduard von Hartmann,<a class="ref" id="ref34.1" href="#note34.1">1</a>
<em>humor</em> arises from a combination of the comic with the touching,
with the tragic, or with both simultaneously. The moral and aesthetic
significance of humor lies precisely in the fact that it draws higher values
into the whirlpool of the comic imagination, yet ultimately
allows what is morally valuable to emerge and crystallize.

<p>Cervantes’ Quixote is really humorous because
the author has endowed him with noble qualities that prevail over
the comical aspects of his character and
secure him our sympathy. In Avellaneda he is merely comical, because
only his ridiculous aspects emerge. The
difference between the two treatments is best seen in the endings. How
touchingly comical is the end of Don Quixote’s knightly career
in Cervantes! First his pain at his unlucky defeat;
then his sincere joy at Don Gaspar Gregorio’s return; his
comical decision to turn shepherd; and finally his mental
recovery and his death, through which he, Alonso Quijada the Good, leaves
his relatives and friends deeply saddened — all this is portrayed
by the author so humorously and touchingly
that the finale of Avellaneda’s novel, that locks up Don Quixote in a
madhouse, cannot but seem crude and tasteless. In the former
<a id="p35"><span class="pagenum">p35</span></a>
the humor rises to such a high degree of pathos that it
borders on the tragic; in the latter the merely comic descends into banality.

<p>The brave squire Sancho in both works requires special consideration.
He is naïvely humorous; he acts
humorously according to his nature, his disposition. Avellaneda’s Sancho
is definitely his best character. In this respect we can agree, albeit
cautiously, with Lesage’s judgment:<a class="ref" id="ref35.1" href="#note35.1">1</a>
Avellaneda was best at coarse comedy. However, to me his Sancho
does not seem free of extraneous influences. While in Cervantes we still
see pure character comedy in the squire, we find on the other hand that
Avellaneda exaggerates individual traits that have a comic effect — his rustic
mode of speech, his enormous appetite, etc. — in such a way that they almost
become ends in themselves. Sancho thus moves into the
sphere of the “figure of fun” [<i>lustige Person</i>], specifically the
<i>gracioso</i> of Spanish comedy. This relationship with the
<i>gracioso</i> is particularly evident in the caricature of the knight by the
servant.<a class="ref" id="ref35.2" href="#note35.2">2</a> In front of the
“Archipampano,” for example, the squire imitates his master in posture and
speech.<a class="ref" id="ref35.3" href="#note35.3">3</a>
I will quote both speeches verbatim, as to me they seem
characteristic of Avellaneda’s style.

<p>Don Quixote: <span class="Av">“... Don Quixote, still standing in the
middle of the room, looking around very seriously, with the point of his
lance, which had been brought him by a servant, grounded, stayed quiet ...;
and when he saw that they were silent and waiting for him to speak, in
a calm and serious voice he began: Magnanimous, powerful, and ever-august
Archipámpano of the Indies, descendant of the Heliogábalos, Sardanápolos,
and other such emperors of old, today has come into your royal presence
the Loveless Knight, in case you have not heard of him, who, after having traveled
over the most part of our hemisphere, having therein killed and conquered
an infinite number of ogres and extraordinary giants, disenchanted castles,
liberated maidens ...”</span>

<p>Sancho: <span class="Av">“Then Sancho got between them, and looking
back he said to Don Quixote: Give me that lance, so that I may look as
your honor looked when you talked to the Arcapámpanos ...
then steepling his hands without taking off his cap, which caused no little
<a id="p36"><span class="pagenum">p36</span></a>
laughter among the onlookers, he remained quite a while without speaking,
until, seeing that they were silent, he began to speak, trying to begin like
his master Don Quixote, to whose words he had paid no little attention:
Magnanimous, powerful, and always-August <i>harto de pámpanos</i>
[lit. “sick of vine-shoots”] ... Your honor is to know, sir descendant
of the emperor Eliogallos y Sarganápalos, that I am named Sancho Panza,
the squire, husband of Mari-Gutierrez both forward and backward,
in case you have not heard of him ... and, its having been days I’ve
been roaming about on my donkey with my master over the most part of our... —
And turning to his master he said: What the devil do you call it? — Curse you!
answered Don Quixote; <i>hemisphere</i>, you idiot. — Well, what do you want
now? answered Sancho; ... do you think a man should have a memory as long
as the missal? ... Then I’ll say, continued Sancho, going back to my story,
sir king of the Hemisphere, that up to now I haven’t killed nor dissipated
any such giants as my master says ...”</span>

<p>Sancho’s cowardice can also be seen as a characteristic trait of
the <i>gracioso</i>; cf. his behavior during the adventure of Barbara’s
discovery.

<p>The mostly very lame jokes may have been inspired by those jokers
who, in the costume of his squire, accompanied Don Quixote in the
processions.<a class="ref" id="ref36.1" href="#note36.1">1</a>

<p>One comic element deserves special mention because it
is foreign to Cervantes’ <i>Don Quijote</i>: the <em>obscene</em>. The
obscene has forever been a branch of literature in its own right,
but sometimes it gets so out of hand that it afflicts even true art.
Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> dates from such a time. Just note
the turn to pornography that the picaresque novel took
with Andrés Pérez’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/novelistasposte00novegoog/page/47"><i>Pícara Justina</i></a>. On a
higher artistic level we may find this phenomenon when we observe
the transition from Lope de Vega’s charming lightheartedness
[<i>graziöser Leichtfertigkeit</i>] to the
jocular frivolity [<i>spielenden Frivolität</i>] of Tirso de Molina, which led him
to stage the most daring scenes. This agrees also with the complaints
which have occasionally been raised about the people who take such pleasure
in the immorality portrayed on the
stage.<a class="ref" id="ref36.2" href="#note36.2">2</a>
A part of Avellaneda’s guilt, therefore, we can assign to his
era. A dirty joke, whether it is cleverly disguised or clumsily
exposed, is alike immoral. Though Sancho himself is not given
to well-chosen expressions, yet it falls to Barbara to bring
smut into the Don Quixote–fable. One example will suffice:

<p><span class="Av">“Sir knight, she </span>(Barbara)<span class="Av"> replied, I wish I were fifteen
<a id="p37"><span class="pagenum">p37</span></a>
years old and more beautiful than Lucretia, so that I might serve
you with all the faculties I have or can ever have; but you can believe that
if we arrive in Alcalá, I’ll serve you there, as you’ll see, a couple of
tarts [<i>truchas</i>, lit. ”fish“] not over fourteen, marvelous good and not very costly.
Don Quixote, who did not understand Barbara’s tune, replied:
My dear lady, I am not a man given overmuch to
eating and drinking; I leave that to my squire Sancho Panza; still,
if those tarts are hardy [<i>si esas truchas fueren empanadas</i>]
I’ll pay for them and we’ll take them for the road in our saddlebags;
although in truth my squire Sancho, in grinding his mill,
will leave hardly a crumb behind”</span> (Cap. XXIII).
Thus, Barbara’s offer is intended to put the knight’s virtue in a
comical light, as in several other instances is Sancho’s
harmlessness. How much more ingenious is the satirical treatment of
the same motif in Cervantes! Don Quixote, who, following the example
of his role model Amadis, always boasts of his virtuous
constancy,<a class="ref" id="ref37.1" href="#note37.1">1</a>
imagines himself nocturnally sought out by lovelorn princesses.

<p>Sancho is also responsible for most of the stylistic comedy. Here we find
the same methods of comic representation as in Cervantes:
rustic idiom, the quotation of proverbs, malapropisms
(see the previous page’s example), etc. Added to this is
Sancho’s friendly relationship with Rocinante and the donkey and
the way he <span class="unclear" title="das Hineinlegen von menschlichen Fähigkeiten in die Reittiere">invests the animals with human traits</span>.
Here too Cervantes was the model.<a class="ref" id="ref37.2" href="#note37.2">2</a>

<p>Occasionally Avellaneda attempts a <em>grotesque style</em>, e.g.:
<span class="Av">“I swear by the order of my knighthood that, only because of what you
have said, and so that you will understand that there can be no fear
whatsoever in my heart, I’m ready to return to the village and challenge
to single combat not only that priest, but also all the priests, vicars, sextons,
canons, archdeacons, deans, preceptors, prebendaries, and curates in
all the Roman, Greek, and Latin churches, and all the barbers, doctors,
surgeons, and veterinarians who fight under the flags of Aesculapius, Galen,
Hippocrates, and Avicenna”</span> (Cap. IV). The descriptions of Sancho’s
<a id="p38"><span class="pagenum">p38</span></a>
tremendous appetite are also reminiscent of similar ones in Rabelais’
<i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i> and Luigi Pulci’s
<i>Morgante maggiore</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref38.1" href="#note38.1">1</a>

<p>Avellaneda’s comical locutions arise not infrequently from the
associating of things that do not belong together [that is, syllepsis];
for example, <span class="Av">“Here there is no castle nor fortification
[<i>fortaleza</i>]; or if there is, it is that of wine”</span> (Cap. IV).
Again: <span class="Av">“With those [eighty ducats] and notable pleasure
we left together one afternoon for Alcalá”</span> (Cap. XXIII).
Such things we also find in other comic poets, in Heinrich Heine,
and often in French.


<p class="blank">In a discussion of the <em>literary influences</em>
(aside from Cervantes’ Part I) that contributed to the false <i>Quijote</i>
I should hardly be able to come anywhere close to completeness,
since most of the books of chivalry have become bibliographical rarities
and have been therefore inaccessible to me. But this is
not so important, since from the little available to us
we can see how little knowledge of chivalric romances the author himself
possessed.

<p>Almost everything from <i>Amadis de Gaula</i><a class="ref" id="ref38.2" href="#note38.2">2</a>
which we find in the false <i>Quijote</i> has been already introduced by Part I.
The novel (Cap. XXXII) cites an episode in which the hero is said to have been
almost killed by a sorcerer using a concoction of sand and cold water; but there
is nothing corresponding to this in <i>Amadis de Gaula</i>.
Perhaps we are dealing with a parodistic imitation
of a similar enchantment in <i>Amadis</i> (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=16xwPFdYmPIC&pg=PA50">I.19</a>). Urganda’s imprisonment
by the sorcerer Fristón (Cap. XXII), has no direct model either: although
in <i>Esplandián</i> (Ch. 121) we do find
Urganda in the power of the Infanta Melia. In <i>Amadis de Grecia</i>
an unknown knight appears who turns out to be the Infanta Gradafilea:
this could have served as a model for the Burlerina episode. When
at the end of the false <i>Quijote</i> it is reported that the hidalgo
<a id="p39"><span class="pagenum">p39</span></a>
continued his adventures in the company of a woman disguised as a man,
we find something similar in the <i>Florisel de Niquea</i> (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3p7wnBfCnFYC&pg=PP281">III.78</a>),
where Finistea attends Amadis de Grecia dressed in men’s clothing.
The <i>Belianis de Grecia</i> is quoted in detail: the adventure of the hero and
another knight (Av. Cap. XII) with some savages and the raging Roland
(Cap. VI) according to the <i>Espejo de Caballerías</i>. The adventure of
a Greek prince in an enchanted castle reported in
Cap. XXVI<a class="ref" id="ref39.1" href="#note39.1">1</a>
is reminiscent of <span class="unclear" title="I’m not sure which">an adventure</span>
experienced by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jSakTjczF2YC&pg=PP11">Cirongilio de Thracia</a>
(cf. <i>D. Q.</i> I.32). Otherwise Avellaneda mentions only names, but even
then he is imprecise, e.g. <span class="Av"><i>“Amadis de Gaula,”</i></span>
<span class="Av"><i>“don Belianis de Grecia
y su hijo (!) Esplandián,”</i></span> etc. (Cap. II). (Esplandián is in fact the son of
Amadis). The giants who, with iron maces, block the castle entrance
(Cap. IX) are known to me only from the
<i>Huon de Bordeaux</i><a class="ref" id="ref39.2" href="#note39.2">2</a> —
which, to my knowledge, has never been translated into Spanish.

<p>To compensate for his limited knowledge of the chivalric tales [<i>der Ritterbücher</i>],
Avellaneda made even greater use of the romances [<i>die Romanzen</i>]. My opinion is
that these poems of patriotic spirit are ill fitted for
a satire that aims primarily at chivalric romance’s ideals of courtly love and
courtly life. However, courtly
elements also find their way into later Spanish romance poetry.

<p>Personal names from the Cid cycle appear frequently in the false
<i>Quijote</i> (Cap. II, III, VI, etc.); specifically mentioned are the conquest
of Zamora (Cap. VI) and the insult to the dead Cid by a Jew,
and the latter’s punishment (Cap. VI). Also cited are the romances
which deal with the conquest of Spain by the Moors (Count Julian,
Don Rodrigo, Florinda, Pelayo, Sandoval, etc.) and the Calaínos stories
which belong to the Carolingian cycle (<i>Ya cabalga Calaínos</i>,<a class="ref" id="ref39.3" href="#note39.3">3</a>
etc., Cap. VII; cf. <i>D. Q.</i> I.9). From the poems <i>Marqués de
Mantua</i> and <i>Baldovinos</i> comes the marquis’ oath<a class="ref" id="ref39.4" href="#note39.4">4</a>
(Av. Cap. IV and XII) also quoted in <i>D. Q.</i> I.10.
The secretary (Cap. XII) parodies it
thus: <span class="Av">“I swear, by the order of secretaryhood that I have received,
that I shall not eat bread from the floor, nor trifle with the queen of spades, hearts,
<a id="p40"><span class="pagenum">p40</span></a>
clubs, or diamonds, nor sleep on the point of my sword, until I take
such bloody vengeance on Prince Don Quijote de La Mancha that
his arms will remain hanging from his shoulders and his legs and thighs stay
attached to his hips, his head will wander, and his mouth, despite all those
now born or yet to be born, remain fixed under his nose.”</span>
Finally, the romance of the Fall of Troy is mentioned:
<span class="Av"><i>“Fuego suena, fuego suena, que se nos alza
Troya con Elena”</i></span> (Cap. VIII).

<p>A whole host of names and allusions have been provided by the lives of the saints
and Biblical stories, and in such abundance that
one might call Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> more orthodox
than the genuine one. Almost exclusively it is antiquity that is represented.
From contemporary literature, Avellaneda mentions Lope de
Vega (<i>Testimonio vengado</i>, <i>Filis</i>, <i>Celia</i>, <i>Lucinda</i>) and
Cervantes (Escarraman, Cap. XXXI, from Cervantes’ entremés titled <i>El rufián viudo</i>);
from the older literature, the <i>Celestina</i>, Ariosto, and Petrarch. —


<p class="blank">Just as Cervantes in his Part I included the novella of
<i>El curioso impertinente</i>, Avellaneda does not fail
to embellish his <i>Don Quijote</i> with novellas. The first bears the title of
<i>El rico desesperado</i>.

<div class="novella">
<p>A young law student in Lovaina (Leuven), who leads a dissolute
life, is converted by the sermon of a Dominican and decides
to enter a monastery. As his novitiate draws to a close,
he receives a visit from two friends who try to coax him back
into the world. Despite the prior’s efforts to keep him, he
returns to worldly life; and some time later he marries
a wealthy and virtuous lady who has
also until then been living in a convent. After three years
of happily wedded life, he is offered the opportunity to
take up a governorship left vacant by the death of his uncle.
He therefore travels to Brussels at the very time when his wife
is expecting to become a mother. On the way back he meets a Spanish soldier
and offers him hospitality in his house. There
he learns that his wife has just given birth to a boy.
They therefore take their meal at the new mother’s bedside. The sight of the beautiful
woman arouses criminal desires in the soldier. The fact
that he is sleeping in the next room, but the husband is in a further
room, allows a devilish plan to ripen in his mind. At night he goes
<a id="p41"><span class="pagenum">p41</span></a>
to the woman, who thinks she is receiving her husband and
reproaches him for his intemperance. After the soldier has
accomplished his goal without being recognized, he sets off early in the
morning. When the wife jokingly brings up her husband’s nocturnal visit,
at first he does not understand her, but then he suspects
the true connection. Without comment,
he hurries on horseback after the soldier. He catches up with him and stabs him.
Meanwhile, the woman also — through her husband’s mutterings, overheard and
retold by a stable boy — has recognized the true state of affairs.
In her despair, she throws herself into a well,
and so atones for her unknowing adultery. When her returning
husband hears of her death, he dashes his newborn son to death on
the edge of the well and kills himself in the same way as his wife.
</div>

<p>If we ignore the brutality expressed in this story,
it is the best that Avellaneda has written.
The style is more meticulous than usual. Namely, the tragic effect is
heightened by the succinct depiction of the catastrophe. The manner
in which the somewhat offensive material is handled is genuinely Spanish. Even the
fatalistic conceit that this unfortunate outcome is a punishment
for leaving the monastic life corresponds perfectly to the religious
worldview that then prevailed in Spain. Self-revenge also
seems here to be completely justified. Every Spaniard who has offended
a member of his family is himself the “physician of his own honor”
[alluding to Pedro Calderón’s <i>El médico de su honra</i>, 1637].
So must this material, with its deeply tragic content — an unconscious adultery
that obliges the husband to revenge and the wife to atone — have appealed
peculiarly to the Spanish mind.

<p>The same motif is widespread in other world literature.
The most famous version is Boccaccio’s story<a class="ref" id="ref41.1" href="#note41.1">1</a>
of Agilulf and the Stablehand, which treats the material in a humorous way:
<span class="synopsis">A horse-groom lies with the wife of King Agilulf, who learns the fact,
keeps his own counsel, finds out the groom and shears him. The shorn shears
all his fellows, and so comes safe out of the scrape</span> (<i>Decameron</i>, Day 3, Tale 2).
Of all the adaptations of the same material recorded by Landau<a class="ref" id="ref41.2" href="#note41.2">2</a>
the closest to our novella are the Old English ballad
<i>Glasgerion</i> and the Scottish <i>Glenkindie</i>, in which the deceived woman
kills herself and her husband kills both the villainous servant and
<a id="p42"><span class="pagenum">p42</span></a>
himself.<a class="ref" id="ref42.1" href="#note42.1">1</a>
Even more similarities are contained in the twenty-third story
of Marguerite de Navarre’s <i>Heptaméron</i> (not mentioned by Landau):
<span class="synopsis">Three murders in one house: to wit, the husband, his wife, and their child,
by the wickedness of a Cordelier <nobr>[<span class="long">=</span> a</nobr> Franciscan friar].</span>
Either this novella served as a source for Avellaneda, or both authors made use
of a shared source. Not mentioned in Landau are a number of
Spanish comedies in which the motif of involuntary adultery recurs.
It is the starting point for the plot of Juan Grajales’
<i>El bastardo de Ceuta</i>: <span class="synopsis">Elvira, the wife of Captain Melendez,
when in the darkness she thinks she is receiving her husband,
is visited by the ensign Gomez de Melo. A son is the
fruit of this adultery. The husband takes revenge only many years later.</span>
The same nocturnal deception plays a role in Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla’s
<i>El médico de su amor</i>; in Lope de Vega’s <i>La prudencia en el castigo</i>;
and in the <i>Audiencias del rey don Pedro</i>, which Schack attributes to
Lope de Vega. In this last comedy, the insulted woman takes revenge
upon herself. The motif appears, to comic effect,
in Ricardo de Turia’s <i>La burladora burlada</i>.

<p>The most well known is the nightly deception perpetrated twice by Don
Juan Tenorio in Gabriel Téllez’s <i>El burlador de Sevilla</i>: once
upon Isabella, the fiancée of Duke Octavio, and the second time on Doña
Ana, Don Gonzalo’s daughter and the bride of the Marqués de la Mota.
Since this play is sufficiently well known, a detailed discussion may be omitted.

<p>Also born of a Catholic-religious spirit is the other
tale, that of <i>Los felices amantes</i> (Cap. XVII–XX).

<div class="novella">
<p>Don Gregorio sees in a convent the beautiful Doña Luisa,
who, at only 25 years old, is already prioress. He has known her
since his youth. Now love for her awakens in him. A minor service which
he does for her leads to a long conversation, in the course of which
he confesses his love to her. The language he uses is in
the gallant conversational register, contrived and affected to the point of
incomprehensibility.<a class="ref" id="ref42.2" href="#note42.2">2</a>
We see that the nuns at that time were very fond of listening to
<a id="p43"><span class="pagenum">p43</span></a>
young gentlemen’s declarations of love.<a class="ref" id="ref43.1" href="#note43.1">1</a>
In a second conversation the next day, the prioress confesses that she
returns his love. In six months, their mutual affection has grown
so much that Luisa offers to elope with Gregorio. In order
that they should have money, she raids the convent’s treasures, while he
does the same to his parents’ possessions. Before she leaves the cloister,
she kneels one last time before the image of the Virgin, to whom she is very devoted,
and hands her the keys to the convent. Then she flees with her
lover to Lisbon, where they lead such a lavish life that
their fortune is completely consumed, except for a small remainder, which Don Gregorio
gambles away. On foot they travel to Badajoz
in Castile, where they are admitted to the hospital [i.e., the poorhouse]. Luisa wants to
earn her living as a laundress. The hospital manager
woos her. Don Gregorio persuades his supposed wife to accept the manager’s suit,
as he hopes to profit from it. Luisa sinks deeper and
deeper. She becomes a common prostitute. This life lasts until the
son of a respected citizen is stabbed to death in front of her house. Luisa
is therefore taken into custody, but is soon released again thanks to
the intervention of the hospital administrator. Don Gregorio has to
leave the city. He goes to Madrid, where he enters the service
of a nobleman. Meanwhile, Luisa, who has grown tired of the life of a courtesan,
has decided to return to her convent
and atone there for her sins. That night, dressed as
a pilgrim, she leaves Badajoz and walks to her old convent.
At midnight she comes, after suffering many hardships,
to the cloister chapel. She finds the door open and her
bunch of keys on the altar where she had left them. Then she hears
the image of the Virgin Mary calling her by name. The Virgin announces to her that
she herself has taken up Luisa’s position as prioress during her four-year absence.
She is to go to her cell and put on her nun’s habit.
The next morning, Luisa sees that no one
has missed her. She confesses her guilt and the Virgin Mary’s miracle
to the convent’s confessor.

<p>Divine grace is shown to Gregorio, also.
His conscience is awakened by a Dominican’s sermon on the fate of a man
(clearly Theophilus) who had devoted himself to the devil
<a id="p44"><span class="pagenum">p44</span></a>
but was saved from damnation by the Virgin Mary. He confesses and goes to Rome
to obtain forgiveness for his sins. When he returns, he goes
to Luisa’s convent. To his inquiry after the runaway nun,
he receives the answer that she is still prioress and that she is highly respected
for her holy way of life. Wholly baffled by this information, he goes
to his parents’ house, to whom he — a second Saint Alexius —
without revealing his identity brings news of their son, whom he claims
to have seen in Naples. There he learns that his
parents did not miss the money he had stolen from them.
Mary miraculously replaced it, just as she did the treasures
taken from the convent.

<p>Eventually his mother recognizes him. But in his decision
to become a monk he remains steadfast. From the prioress he hears
the miracle that kept her absence a secret. He
enters a monastery, becomes its prelate, and dies on the same
day and at the same hour as the prioress.
</div>

<p>This story is a novelistic adaptation of the Marian miracle story
known as the <em>Legend of Beatrice</em>.<a class="ref" id="ref44.1" href="#note44.1">1</a>
In the Middle Ages, ever since Caesarius of Heisterbach (1223),<a class="ref" id="ref44.2" href="#note44.2">2</a>
this legend was often treated in Latin<a class="ref" id="ref44.3" href="#note44.3">3</a>
and in the common tongues;<a class="ref" id="ref44.4" href="#note44.4">4</a>
and in modern times by Charles Nodier,<a class="ref" id="ref44.5" href="#note44.5">5</a>
Gottfried Keller (<i>Sieben Legenden</i>, 1872), and Maurice Maeterlinck
(in drama).<a class="ref" id="ref44.6" href="#note44.6">6</a>
It is one of the Marian miracles that support the view
that the Mother of God, to even the greatest sinner, for even
the smallest service, grants her help and grace.
Watenphul (<i>op. cit.</i>) has studied the relationships among the medieval
framings. He tries to trace them all back to the form provided by Caesarius of Heisterbach
and distinguishes, in the further development of the legend, two groups:

<div class="indented-list">
<p>1.&nbsp; Direct descendants from Caesarius of Heisterbach.
<a id="p45"><span class="pagenum">p45</span></a>

<p>2.&nbsp; The form that arose from the fusion of the original legend with
the “nun from the monastery” type (Mussafia): <span class="synopsis">The
nun, in leaving the convent, is stopped twice by the Virgin Mary; the third time,
she passes the statue of Mary without a glance, and is able to leave.</span> To this
group we may add another legend, which Legrand-d’Aussy<a class="ref" id="ref45.1" href="#note45.1">1</a>
also classes as a Beatrix legend: <span class="synopsis">A nun (referred to neither as a sexton nor
by name) is seduced by the nephew of the abbess. Otherwise in agreement
with the legend of Beatrix the sexton.</span>
</div>

<p>The identification of the source for Avellaneda’s novella is not
immediately resolved by the reference to the
<i>Discipulus</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref45.2" href="#note45.2">2</a>
This is because his tale contains much more than the
<i>Discipulus</i>,<a class="ref" id="ref45.3" href="#note45.3">3</a>
which itself only copies Caesarius. The content of that version is as follows:

<p><span class="synopsis">The sexton Beatrice, an ardent admirer of the Virgin Mary,
leaves the convent to follow her lover, entrusting the keys
to Mary. Abandoned by her seducer, she lives fifteen years as
a prostitute. Finally she returns; no one has noticed her absence,
because Mary has taken her place.</span>

<p>The motif of the theft of the money by the lovers and
its miraculous reinstatement by the Virgin is borrowed from the legend
of the <i>Knight’s Wife and the Cleric</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref45.4" href="#note45.4">4</a>
The returning nun’s question at the monastery door resp. in the neighboring house —
characteristic of all descendants of Caesarius von Heisterbach — is missing;
in its place is Gregorio’s inquiry. The legend does not tell of the
further fate of the seducer. Avellaneda’s whole section dealing with Gregorio’s
return was significantly influenced by the <i>Vie de saint Alexis</i>.
In common with some later versions
(Old Icelandic,<a class="ref" id="ref46.1" href="#note46.1">1</a>
Middle Dutch,<a class="ref" id="ref46.2" href="#note46.2">2</a>
and Nodier), but in any case independently
introduced by Avellaneda, is the assumption of a childhood acquaintance
between the prioress and the young man. From his mind also come the names of
the characters and the geographical setting of the narrative. Details,
the conversations of the lovers, the stay in Lisbon, in Badajoz, etc.,
are presented novelistically, so that the old legendary aspect is almost
completely overshadowed. After subtracting the legendary elements,
our novella has a certain likeness to François Prévost’s <i>Manon Lescaut</i>
(1728). The hero of this novel, after having gambled away the dregs of his
fortune, remains with his lover, who by her shame supports both him and herself.

<p>I complete the list of versions given by Watenphul
by citing two Spanish adaptations:

<div class="indented-list">
<p>1.&nbsp; Calderon de la Barca, in the <i>Purgatorio de San Patricio</i>.
Ludovico Enio tells King Egerio in Act I of this play that he
has seduced, abducted and married a nun; has gone with her to Valencia;
and there, after squandering his fortune, has tried to
make money by her dishonor. She, however, refused,
and fled back to the convent. — This version lacks the miracle.

<p>2.&nbsp; Lope de Vega made the legend the subject of his play
<i>La Buena Guarda</i>.
<span class="synopsis">Doña Clara de Lara, Mother Superior of a convent, has a reputation for
holiness, but allows herself to be seduced into love and flight by her majordomo Felis.
Her place in the convent, during her absence, is taken by
an angel in her semblance; which angel, after she has repented and
done penance, returns her office to her.</span> —
The version of the legend on which this piece is based is
represented by the manuscript Brit.&nbsp;Mus. Additional 33956
(early 14th century),<a class="ref" id="ref46.3" href="#note46.3">3</a>
where also an angel stands in as the nun’s
representative.<a class="ref" id="ref46.4" href="#note46.4">4</a>
</div>

<p>A final judgment on Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> can be
<a id="p47"><span class="pagenum">p47</span></a>
given in a few words. That it is far inferior to Cervantes’ work,
after the foregoing considerations, cannot be in any doubt.
But anyone must admit that it is, in the reading, wholly entertaining.
The comedy is crude but plentiful.
Tubino<a class="ref" id="ref47.1" href="#note47.1">1</a>
sums up his opinion in the following words, with which we
happily agree: ”The <i>Quijote</i> of Avellaneda is an entertaining novel;
the <i>Quijote</i> of Cervantes, an eternal imitation of humanity
in all parts of the world, at all times and in all gradations and
walks of life. It amuses firstly by making us laugh, secondly by
bringing melancholy to the soul and putting tears in our eyes.”

<p>Fitzmaurice-Kelly’s verdict<a class="ref" id="ref47.2" href="#note47.2">2</a>
is more favorable: “It is, in fact, a work
of considerable interest and entertainment and, were Cervantes not in
possession of the field, it would still find readers.” Yet if Cervantes’
<i>Quijote</i> had never been written, we can surely say that Avellaneda
would never have authored his.

<center style="margin-top: 3em;">
<h3-em>Second Part.</h3-em><br>
<h3>Lesage’s Adaptation of Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i>.</h3>
</center>

<p>After Lesage had broached the dramatic arena with translations from the Spanish
(<i>Théâtre espagnol</i>, 1700), he established himself
as a novelist with another translation from
the Spanish. Or so he describes his adaptation
of Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i>, although the first volume is a very
free translation, and the second is almost entirely original.

<p>The book did not meet with particular success, although
the <i>Journal des Sçavans</i> (1704,
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KzsRCghmRRQC&pg=PA207">page 207</a>)
described it favorably:
“The French reader will not notice Avellaneda’s crudity
in the translation that is today given to the public; its style
is easy and without blunder. We are obliged to the author for the care
he took to give his translation so French a turn and mannerism
that we no longer recognize the faults that Cervantes found
in the original. But it is to be feared that it will be said that he has fallen
into another fault; that is, to repeat too often certain popular mannerisms,
such as <i>Par la gerny</i>, <i>Mardy</i>, <i>Oh dame</i>, and
<a id="p48"><span class="pagenum">p48</span></a>
many others. True, it is in Sancho’s mouth that he
puts them; but can one not say that they are too frequent
and that one tires of them?”


<p class="blank"><a id="IIp1"><b>I.</b></a>&nbsp; Avellaneda’s thirty-six chapters correspond to
Lesage’s seventy. As the story progresses,
the editor ranges further from his model.

<p>Avellaneda’s Capítulo I — corresponds to Lesage’s Chapitres 1 and 2, and part of 3.&nbsp;
On the Sunday after his first visit, Sancho brings the chivalric novel
<i>Florisbran de Candarie</i>, the reading of which awakens the knight’s
old madness. He resolves upon a fourth sally, promising
Sancho a new donkey and sending him to Dulcinea with a letter.
Only some insignificant things are omitted.

<p>Av. Capítulo II — the rest of Chap. 3 and 4 (in part).&nbsp; Dulcinea’s
answer is expanded to include a threat from her brothers. Quite literal.

<p>Av. Capítulo III — Chap. 4–5.&nbsp; Adds a quotation from the

whose friend he becomes. As the fight against Pizarro is going poorly,
there arrives from Spain, as president of an <i>audiencia real</i>,
the licenciate Pierre de la Gasca. Some of Pizarro’s officers submit to him.
Pizarro himself is defeated at Xaguixaguana. As a reward
for his services, Don Raphael receives some Indians and founds a
silver mine, which earns him 100,000 <i>écus</i> in eight years. With this
money he sets sail for Lima. Near Panama he is shipwrecked,
narrowly escapes with his life, and is taken in by Don Michael.
He wins the love of a wealthy lady, Doña Theodora, Doña María’s daughter.
Before Doña María gives him her daughter, she tells him her story.

<p>She, to save her brother, who had killed the governor’s nephew, gave herself
to the governor. From this union sprang

punished her; she and her daughter were shamed;

<p>The noblest and most useful deed of Don Quixote. The freeing of a
girl from the clutches of some robbers. A young nobleman
is supported by Don Quixote in this.

<p>One of the robbers, mortally wounded, tells how years ago
he murdered a rich farmer and a nurse, whose infant he gave
to a widow to raise. Then the beautiful Engracia — that being the girl’s name —
tells her story. She is the daughter of Don Fernando de Peralta,
who fell commanding a ship in the Armada. Shortly after his death
a son was born, who, going out one day with his nurse, disappeared
without a trace. Engracia grows up in the care of her uncle Don Diego.
She makes the acquaintance of Don Cristobal de Luna, grows to love him,
and lets him visit her secretly at night. One day, when she goes to
let him in, she finds him murdered. Because she believes her life also
to be in danger, she flees to one Mrs. Paule. This woman betrays her
to the very robber band from whose clutches Don Cesar
<a id="p51"><span class="pagenum">p51</span></a>
and Don Quixote have just freed her. Don Cesar, who knows Don Cristobal,
tells her that Don Cristobal was not dead, but only wounded; but
that because of his unfaithfulness he does not deserve her love.

<p>Next appears Engracia’s uncle Don Diego. It transpires that
Don Cesar is the long-lost son of Fernando Peralta.

<a id="p53"><span class="pagenum">p53</span></a>
On the way home, Don Quixote has an argument with some troopers of
the <i>Santa Hermandad</i>, kills an officer, and is himself shot.

<p>These chapters represent the ending indicated in Avellaneda’s
Cap. XXXV and XXXVI. This fulfills the second possible
outcome of Don Quixote’s madness. If he did not end up in a
madhouse, he would necessarily eventually come into conflict
with the order of the world. This conclusion, which is related to the
outcome of Part I, is definitely an improvement;
although it is, in aesthetic terms, far inferior to the conclusion
of the real Part II.

<p>A comparison of the two works — the original and the
adaptation — shows how freely Lesage treated the material of
his source. Here and there I have pointed out how his deviations were
influenced by the real <i>Don Quijote</i>.
In revising the book he also benefited from a good knowledge
of the novels of chivalry. He not only refrained from excessive
citations of romances and the lives of the saints, but also
inserted from his own hoard allusions to
chivalric romances. He particularly favored <i>Belianis de Grecia</i>.
He also used the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i>, which he translated in
1712,<a class="ref" id="ref53.1" href="#note53.1">1</a> and the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>.


<p class="blank"><a id="IIp2"><b>II.</b></a>&nbsp;
As to Lesage’s <em>translation technique</em>, if one takes into account
his other translations,<a class="ref" id="ref53.2" href="#note53.2">2</a>
beyond his great liberties with the original no general principles can be established.
In each case his task was different. He had
in the case of the <i>Diable Boiteux</i> (for example) to replace
Guevara’s cultish and overladen style with a lighter language free
of allegorical elements; in the case of Avellaneda,
to liven up its somewhat cumbersome and often overly matter-of-fact language.
His methods, in each case, are of different natures.

<p>He breaks up long constructions. This already shows a hallmark
of his later style: his love of short clear sentences.

<p>The following passage, otherwise reproduced quite literally, is an example:
<a id="p54"><span class="pagenum">p54</span></a>

<table class="table2">
<tr><td>
Av. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1FoOGUrWGAMC&pg=PA2">Cap. I</a>:
<span class="Av">“They addressed him no longer
as Don Quixote, but as Señor Martín Quijada, which was his right name;
but when he wasn’t in earshot they had
some amusing moments with what they’d say about him,
and what they all remembered,
such as the affair of the rescuing or freeing of the galley-slaves ...
So it happened that there came over his niece,
in the month of August, one of those fevers
that physicians call <i>ephemeral</i>,
which last twenty-four hours,
whose effect was such that within
that period of time his niece Madalena
died, leaving the good hidalgo alone and
disconsolate ...”</span>
</td><td>
Lesage <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=G7Ys0-enNiwC&pg=PA3">Chap. 1</a>:
<span class="Lesage">“

Finally, Señor Martín Quexada, since he was no longer called Don Quichotte,
was considered a man entirely returned to his good senses, for which everyone
gave thanks to Heaven. Nobody, however, yet dared to say to him anything
that might have any relation to his past madness; in which, certainly, they
displayed much prudence. It
is true that the jokesters of the village
compensated one another for this discretion
by recounting his adventures. It happened at that time
that the heat of the season caused in his niece
one of those fevers that the physicians
call <i>ephemeral</i>, and which though ordinarily
lasting for only one day, do not fail to be sometimes
very dangerous. In fact, the effect was such that
poor Madelaine died.
The eight hundred ducats that fell to Don Quichotte from her estate
did not prevent him from keenly feeling her death.”</span>

<p>Lesage is more sprawling in his expression, but also more humorous,
more concrete, more personal than Avellaneda.

<p>How the translator succeeds, by specializing a generic way of speaking,
in giving a personal character to his language, is seen in the following examples:

<table class="table2">

</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Following the example of Cid Hamete Benengeli in Cervantes,
Lesage often mentions the fictitious chronicler Alisolan, of whom Avellaneda
after his first chapter completely loses sight; e.g.
Chap. 8, 12, 15, 17, 34, etc. Don Alvaro speaks of his beloved in
the bombastic language of erotic novels. Lesage simplifies
this passage as follows:

<table class="table2">
<tr><td>
Cap. I: <span class="Av"><i>“... por mandado de un serafín

[“at the command of an angel in woman’s clothes, who is

commanded that I leave for these jousts and that I enter into them
in her name, and that I bring her some of
the rich gems and jewels that must be awarded to those

[“A lady whom I love wills that I should appear at the
jousts in Zaragoza as her champion; and I go, at her pleasure,
to contest the prize which must be the reward of the victor.”]
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Don Alvaro is a sensible man, and must thus speak like a
sensible man. Otherwise, Don Quixote’s pompous mode of speech
loses its effect.

<p>The description that Don Alvaro gives of his lady-love
Lesage has placed into Don Quixote’s mouth, as praise of Dulcinea.
It is really better suited for that purpose.

<table class="table2">

<a id="p56"><span class="pagenum">p56</span></a>
<span class="Av"><i>“Fuera de la virtud del ánimo,

<span class="Lesage"><i>“Ses yeux et son teint ont

[“Her eyes and her complexion have the radiance of the sun

<p>This is the conventional description of beauty.<a class="ref" id="ref56.1" href="#note56.1">1</a>

<p>The obscene passages Lesage has either omitted or softened; e.g.,

<table class="table2">
<tr><td>
Cap. IV: <span class="Av"><i>“La disoluta mozuela ...

all the muleteers who passed through that hostel”]
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>But largely Lesage translates so freely that one cannot recognize
the original. Neither does he always leave the order of the material
as he found it. From this one may draw
conclusions about his working method. It seems as if
he always first read a chapter and then wrote it down from memory.
This may explain the seamless interweaving of the
original passages and the insertions, and the thoroughly
French diction. In the clear, pure language we see a good example of
the classical school of the 17th century.


<p class="blank"><a id="IIp3"><b>III.</b></a>&nbsp;
Besides the novella of the <i>Felices Amantes</i>,
Lesage has inserted two other stories. All three are connected into the
main narrative. Raphael de Bracamonte’s story
is grounded on events recorded in Garcilaso
de la Vega’s <i>Historia de las guerras civiles de los españoles en las
Indias</i>,<a class="ref" id="ref56.2" href="#note56.2">2</a>
except that the role of Melchior Verdugo there is not so honorable
as Lesage makes it appear.

<p>Further, the Viceroy Blasco Nuñez himself bears considerable
<a id="p57"><span class="pagenum">p57</span></a>
blame for the uprising of Gonzalo Pizarro and his officers, who
believed they had older rights in the province and did not
approve of the Viceroy’s harsh approach.

<p>The second novella (the story of Engracia and Fernando; see
<a href="#EngraciasStory">pp. 50–52</a>)
has as its historical basis events from the Dutch Revolt
(from the siege of Hulst, 1596, to the capture of Ostend, 1604), which
are reported most extensively by Bentivoglio.<a class="ref" id="ref57.1" href="#note57.1">1</a>

<p>This is not to say that the plot of the novella was invented
by Lesage. Rather, its entire structure suggests that
it is a retelling of a Spanish comedy. The historical events
have so little connection with the core of the story
that they may well have been added by Lesage on the basis of
his historical studies. Otherwise, we find the whole apparatus of a
<i>“comedia di capa y espada”</i> in Calderon’s style: the theft of a child,
kidnapping, rendezvous, nocturnal error, disguise, and finally the
happy resolution of the whole mishmash in a double wedding. I have not
been able to find the original of the novella among the materials available
to me. I am nonetheless convinced that Lesage did not
invent it.

<p>The fragmenting of the story into the individual reports of the people
involved is a cheap means of creating tension, and was used again by Lesage
in <i>Gil Blas</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref57.2" href="#note57.2">2</a>


<p class="blank"><a id="IIp4"><b>IV.</b></a>&nbsp;
<i>“Verisimilitude, though not always found in history,
is essential to the novel.”</i> This law, expressed by
Huet,<a class="ref" id="ref57.3" href="#note57.3">3</a>
is not derived from the ideal novel [<i>Idealroman</i>] of the 17th century, but rather
was, from its origin in the dramatic arena, transferred to the arena of the novel.
Thus its application in novels becomes a generally accepted requirement only
at the end of the 17th or the beginning of the 18th century.
Lesage proceeds, therefore, entirely in the spirit of this
new movement when in his <em>Critique of <i>Don Quijote</i></em> he applies key words
such as <span class="Lesage"><i>“bon sens, raison, vraisemblance”</i></span>, which French
<a id="p58"><span class="pagenum">p58</span></a>
classicism used mostly in relation to other genres of fiction,
in relation to that of the novel.

<p>The first traces of the requirement of probability, however, one finds
in the early days of the reaction against the ideal novel.
As early as 1628, Charles Sorel, in his <i>Remarques sur
les XIV livres du Berger extravagant</i>, applies this rule as a yardstick for
his criticism of Cervantes’ <i>Don Quijote</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref58.1" href="#note58.1">1</a>
After defending himself against the accusation that he had copied <i>Don Quijote</i>,
he offers a criticism of that book which, albeit unfair and partisan, is in some
respects correct. This review of Cervantes’ work
is important because it is the first attempt to regard the work
from a definitely critical viewpoint.

“J’ay voulu attendre que mon histoire ayt esté accomplie pour repasser les yeux
par dessus le livre de ce valeureux Chevalier, & voicy le jugement que j’en puis faire. ...”
I should translate Sorel’s critique on another web page.
-->

<p>If Sorel thinks that Cervantes treats the subject too extensively,
boasting that he can condense all that can be said against chivalric books
into four pages, he would hardly have had the same success
with his four pages that Cervantes had
with his book.

<p>He further accuses Cervantes of vulgar language and a lack of subtle humor.
He finds it improbable that the Duke would spend so much money
to make Sancho a governor and yet not himself a
witness to the squire’s embarrassment. Don Quixote, who takes windmills
for giants and sheep for armies, otherwise seems to him too rational,
his recovery both unmotivated and abrupt. “But finally,” he concludes,
“to say in brief what I think of the story of Don
Quixote: it does not care to go much against the romances, seeing that
it itself is intermixed with an infinity of stories so very romantic
and which have so little appearance of truth that, as such,
one might place it in the ranks of so many others who have
here encountered criticism.”<a class="ref" id="ref58.2" href="#note58.2">2</a>

<p>Sorel, with his one-dimensional principle of realism, fails to measure up
to the task of assessing Cervantes’ ingenious offspring. The strength of
the <i>Don Quijote</i> lies precisely in that it combats the voluptuous decadence
of fantasy by equally fantastical methods. How little can be achieved
in this combat by rational argument is shown by Sorel’s
<i>Berger extravagant</i> itself.

<p>Otherwise, the 17th century
(Clerville,<a class="ref" id="ref59.1" href="#note59.1">1</a>
Scarron, Huet,<a class="ref" id="ref59.2" href="#note59.2">2</a> etc.)
<a id="p59"><span class="pagenum">p59</span></a>
did more justice to the Spaniard. Only
Chapelain<a class="ref" id="ref59.3" href="#note59.3">3</a> raises his voice
in favor of the romances: “If I were absolutely to condemn
the gallantry of Lancelot, I would fear to fall into the error
into which fell the author of the <i>Don Quichotte</i> when he laughed
at the expense of the knights-errant, failing to consider as we do the
era in which they acted, and the mores that were practiced then.”

<p>It was Lesage, in Chap.&nbsp;45 of his <i>Don Quichotte</i>,
who next attempted to criticise the Spanish <i>Don Quijote</i> in
detail. It is a chapter <span class="Lesage"><i>“qu’il faut lire sans prévention”</i></span>
[“which one should read without prejudice”]; but
it was not written without prejudice. The Count, in whose house
the knight is staying, and Don Pedro de Luna undertake in Don Quixote’s presence
to discuss Cid Hamete Benengeli’s book. Don Pedro
attacks it; the Count defends it. Firstly, he criticises digressions
(Don Quixote’s speech about the military arts)
and moralizing: <span class="Lesage">“I would not have a comic novel
stuffed full of frigid dissertations and sober moral treatises.”</span> Then Lesage
brings into play the rule of plausibility. Whether Lesage was aware of Sorel’s
critique it is impossible to say with certainty. Nonetheless he agrees with him
on many points: <span class="Lesage">“He so little respects verisimilitude and
rationality that there is hardly an adventure in the work that is not
told along with some circumstance that eliminates its own possibility.”</span> He
reinforces this with the example of the farmer who could not have
remembered all the names given by the Hidalgo (I.5) and with that
of Sancho, who the morning after the adventure of the fulling mills
repeats everything his master said during the night, though
another time (I.26) he hardly remembers a word of the letter to Dulcinea.
In the chapter in which Don Quixote was knighted [I.3], too, Don Pedro finds
various improbabilities. The Biscayan [I.8] cannot, in his opinion,
use as a shield the cushion on which the ladies are sitting;
and the galley-slaves cannot be freed from their chains as quickly
<a id="p60"><span class="pagenum">p60</span></a>
as Cervantes makes out. But Don Pedro errs in seeing a
mistake when Don Quixote orders Sancho, who never carries a sword,
not to take up his sword in his (Don Quixote’s) defense.
He observes that in the <i>escrutinio</i> the priest
first praises the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, but then congratulates the barber on
owning it only in Italian, which he does not understand. That
Cervantes’ book is full of factual errors and contradictions
is well known. But no one would think of letting these little things
determine their verdict as to its literary value.

<p>Cervantes is concerned only with the immediate effect.
He cares little if a scene which in its own place
produces a good comic effect stands in contradiction with
some other part of his work.<a class="ref" id="ref60.1" href="#note60.1">1</a>
When he fails to give the galley-slaves the necessary time to be freed from
their chains,<a class="ref" id="ref60.2" href="#note60.2">2</a> there
we are dealing with a technique known in Shakespearean drama as
“dual time.”<a class="ref" id="ref60.3" href="#note60.3">3</a>
The author knows how to concentrate our
attention so much on the hero or on a new
development that we utterly forget to consider carefully
the just-interrupted action.

<p>The episodes and novellas fare no better than the
narrative itself. The story of the shepherdess Marcela is of
<span class="Lesage"><i>“une longueur fatiguante”</i></span> [“tiring length”],
the inserted verses are bad, the novella of <i>El curioso impertinente</i>
out of place; but <span class="Lesage">“in books there are sometimes digressions
that are more pleasant than the books themselves.”</span> The story of
Zoraida and the captain is <span class="Lesage">“diffuse.”</span> And how can Dorothea,
who is preoccupied with her misfortunes, play a comedy role?
<span class="Lesage">“I’ll tell you what I think of Dorothea’s story,”</span>
says Don Alvaro: <span class="Lesage">“it seems to me almost entirely beyond
belief [<i>hors du vrai-semblable</i>]. I don’t believe that a
well-bred young girl could have enough daring and resolution
<a id="p61"><span class="pagenum">p61</span></a>
to disguise herself as a man and go to serve a peasant in the middle of
an awful forest. I also cannot believe that Dorothea could have
spent three months with that peasant without anyone recognizing
her for what she was. Even if her beauty didn’t betray her, she
had long and abundant hair: how could she hide it
under her cap? That’s not all: you never see anyone talking
to themselves in a wasteland, and even less speaking loud enough to
be heard clearly at thirty or forty paces.”</span>

<p>We see that Lesage makes significant demands in relation to
<em>outward plausibility</em>. But hear now why
he makes them: <span class="Lesage">“This</span> (such liberties as Cervantes
allows himself) <span class="Lesage">is good for the heroic novel, in which
the miraculous is acknowledged; but not in the comic novel, where all the
actions of ordinary life must be represented naturalistically.”</span>

<p>That last remark is important for Lesage’s view of the
novel. He identifies the comic novel above all with the
realistic [novel], and he has a certain right to do so, since the whole
17th century had done so. From the outset, the comic novel had
considered it its special task to depict reality.
It achieves at first, however, merely a kind of realism that, through its
stuffiness and exaggeration, approaches the comic anyway.

<p>Lesage’s primary error lies in the fact that in
his assessment of the <i>Quijote</i> he was unable to free himself
from the aesthetic tastes of his era.

<p class="blank"><a id="IIp5"><b>V.</b></a>&nbsp;
Everything that we find in Lesage’s later books
is already foreshadowed in his first endeavors. He everywhere repeats
himself.<a class="ref" id="ref61.1" href="#note61.1">1</a>
<i>Gil Blas</i> is the heir of the <i>Diable Boiteux</i>, and whoever
has read <i>Gil Blas</i> already knows half of the <i>Bachelier de Salamanque</i>.
Even in <i>Don Quichotte</i> already occur individual elements of the
<em>satirical description of mores</em> [<i>satirischen Sittenschilderung</i>]
that colors Lesage’s later novels.

<p>An opportunity for satirical remarks is provided by Sancho’s appointment as
governor of the <i>isle des andoüillettes</i> [“Meatball Island,” Chap. 47].
Sancho learns from the secretary disguised as Maroquin l’Enfumé [“Morocco the Sooty”],
squire to the giant Taille-enclume (Tajayunque), all manner of things about
the conditions on his island.<a class="ref" id="ref61.2" href="#note61.2">2</a>

<p>The sages there have invented methods of reducing four ounces of gold
<a id="p62"><span class="pagenum">p62</span></a>
to two, and of transmuting rental contracts and revenue-generating lands
into coals. The poets Sancho resolves to pay well, so that
they will say nothing bad of him: Lesage may well have experienced for himself
that the poetic art provides her husband little nourishment. Meanwhile, the women
there are so splendid that their constant good humor can irk their husbands.
The judges are so clever that they can dispense justice
in their sleep and ruin entire families. But they will
not prevent Sancho from enriching himself, as governors
are wont to do.<a class="ref" id="ref62.1" href="#note62.1">1</a>
And now to the doctors, a favorite theme of Lesage
in his later novels. They are quite splendid on the island.
For example: a president is treated for pleurisy by six
doctors who take such good care of him that soon his end is near.
Five doctors give up on him, saying that he will not live past Sunday;
the sixth manages affairs so skillfully that he doesn’t die until Monday.

<p>Even the literary relationships in Lesage’s <i>Don Quichotte</i>
reappear in his later novels as if they were old acquaintances.
With the two students Don Quixote discourses on
Aristotle’s rules,<a class="ref" id="ref62.2" href="#note62.2">2</a>
the impracticability of which is demonstrated via the plot
of a Spanish comedy. This speech reminds us of the dispute
between the two authors in the <i>Diable Boiteux</i><a class="ref" id="ref62.3" href="#note62.3">3</a>
and Gil Blas’ literary conversations with Fabrice.

<p>The influence of the chivalric romances, which left its mark
all over the novels of the 17th century,<a class="ref" id="ref62.4" href="#note62.4">4</a>
is also evident in Lesage’s novels. We have already demonstrated that he
had an excellent knowledge of this literary genre. Gil Blas
also finds chivalric tales in the library at Lirias: “I guiltily confess,”
he says, “that I did not hate even these productions, despite
all the extravagances of which they are woven, either because I was not
then a reader inclined to inspect them so closely, or because the depiction of
the marvelous renders the Spaniard too
indulgent.”<a class="ref" id="ref62.5" href="#note62.5">5</a>
Perhaps it is Lesage himself who makes this confession.

<p>Comparisons with the chivalric romances are not uncommon. Gil
<a id="p63"><span class="pagenum">p63</span></a>
Blas is struck by the beauty of the entering Antonia just
as are the paladins at Charlemagne’s court by Angelica’s
charms.<a class="ref" id="ref63.1" href="#note63.1">1</a>
Lesage calls some sword-fighters <i>“Fierabrases,”</i><a class="ref" id="ref63.2" href="#note63.2">2</a>
some courtesans as dangerous for the young “as those beautiful noble ladies
who arrested with their charms the knights who passed by their
castles.”<a class="ref" id="ref63.3" href="#note63.3">3</a>

<p>Elsewhere he pokes fun at the drawn-out style of the chivalric
novels.<a class="ref" id="ref63.4" href="#note63.4">4</a>
He says of a printer of chivalric books that he enriches
himself at the expense of good taste.<a class="ref" id="ref63.5" href="#note63.5">5</a>

<p>In his adaptation of Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i> he parodies
the chivalric books by way of Burlerina’s narrative. The pastoral episode
contained therein interests us particularly as a satire on the
pastoral novel.<a class="ref" id="ref63.6" href="#note63.6">6</a>

<p>The sorcerer Fristón throws Burlerina out of the window
with such force that from the neighborhood of the Black Sea she falls into the Lignon,
the same river in which Céladon<a class="ref" id="ref63.7" href="#note63.7">7</a>
was almost drowned. Luckily, she is fished out
by the shepherd Persino. She, naturally,
immediately tells him her whole story; in return he tells her
his. He is a prince who, due to his unhappy love for Zenobia, has
become a shepherd. He describes his idyllic life: <span class="Lesage">“Sometimes I
take my flute or my musette, and sometimes I compose verses on the
marvels of nature. I depict the beauties of the countryside. In
my poems one can hear the birds singing. One can see the
playful lambs leap beside the loving ewes, and the murmuring
brooks carry over the verdant grass their crystalline waves.”</span>
He lacks only a shepherdess to perfectly complete his tranquil happiness.
By excellent happenstance, the shepherdess’s role tremendously amuses
Burlerina. She calls herself Philis and takes over
half of his flock and a dog named Melampe; this is also the name of Astrée’s dog.
Her loving shepherd writes for her in less than
<a id="p64"><span class="pagenum">p64</span></a>
a year two hundred eclogues, as many elegies, and more than a
thousand rondeaux. <span class="Lesage">“On one of those days, which I’ll remember all
my life, he sang me a song that, I’ll tell you, transported me.
I lost my breath. I thought that I might die from an excess
of rapture. Here are the words:</span>

<div class="poem">
<span class="Lesage">“Once upon a sward of flowers<br>
Persino, full of love, descried<br>
His beloved Philis sleeping.<br>
You’ll never guess what next he tried:<br>
Sweetly, softly, he approached her<br>
And, to give his torment rest,<br>
Rapt to find her such a beauty,<br>
Gazed on her with tenderness.”</span>
</div>

<p>Their happiness, however, lasts little longer. One
day Burlerina’s half-brother Rosinel comes and takes her away with him. Her
shepherd dies of heartbreak: <span class="Lesage">“He made the strand and the wood resound
with his pitiable regrets; he threw down his flute, broke his crook, tore off his
eyebrows; and, to use one of Homer’s most beautiful comparisons,
he rolled on the earth as one sees a sausage roll on the coals.
Finally the thrice- or four times unfortunate Persino played his last card and
took his own life, in our presence, out of fine madness and pure love.”</span>
As they travel, Rosinel and his sister tell each other stories of chivalric
adventure. She passionately loves the chivalric books and is sure that
reading them will someday make her go mad.

<p>Throughout the rest of this history Lesage skillfully employs
the burlesque style. Burlerina’s story is one of the best
satirical components of his book and surpasses the original by far
in the soundness and freshness of its comedy.

<p>Besides a mention of Don Quixote in the <i>Valise trouvée</i>,<a class="ref" id="ref64.1" href="#note64.1">1</a>
the Don Quixote motif recurs twice more in Lesage’s works.
In the chapter on dreams in the <i>Diable Boiteux</i><a class="ref" id="ref64.2" href="#note64.2">2</a>
it is said of a countess: “She is a reader of novels, with a head full of
the ideals of chivalry. She has a rather amusing dream. She dreams that she is
the Empress of Trebisonde; that she is accused of adultery; and that the knight
who presents himself to champion her innocence is vanquished by her accuser.”
<a id="p65"><span class="pagenum">p65</span></a>
We find the “female Don Quixote”<a class="ref" id="ref65.1" href="#note65.1">1</a>
given detailed treatment in the <i>Bachelier de Salamanque</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref65.2" href="#note65.2">2</a>
The bachelor is hired, as tutor for her son, by a Marquise whose passion for
chivalric romances — of which she owns a whole library — goes so far that she
wants to reenact chivalric adventures of love. The clever
Don Chérubin de la Ronda discovers her madness and
is quite amenable to it. “So Monsieur le Bachelor of Salamanca
was changed into a knight-errant. We began, the Marquise
and I, to speak to each other as heroes of romance. I borrowed the style
of the Knight of the Sun and she borrowed that of Princess Lindabrides. We
conversed every day in the highest tones; but by misfortune it sometimes
happened that the heroine became a little too tender and
the hero too passionate.” The return of the Marquise’s husband puts
an end to this idyll.

<p>The Don Quixote motif, in this sketchy treatment,
no longer has its original polemical sharpness and wide-ranging
signification. That Lesage presents a female Don Quixote
is suggestive. He apparently could not imagine
that a man could be subject in such a high degree to aesthetic illusion.
Amarylle, in the literarily significant 13th book of the
<i>Berger extravagant</i>,<a class="ref" id="ref65.3" href="#note65.3">3</a>
defends novels as being the only means of education
for the female sex, who in all matters are so poorly
<a id="p66"><span class="pagenum">p66</span></a>
and inappropriately informed. The natural consequence of this inadequate
education is the inability of the female sex to view
books’ offerings critically.

<p>The other French imitations of <i>Don Quijote</i>, too,
limit themselves to literary polemic. In addition to the already-mentioned
novels <i>Le Berger extravagant</i> and <i>Le Gascon extravagant</i>,
in the 17th century there remains to mention Du Verdier’s
<i>Chevalier Hipocondriaque</i><a class="ref" id="ref66.1" href="#note66.1">1</a>
(1632), which is directed against the heroic novel.

<p>As Lesage, so Marivaux also ventures into the realm of the novel
with an imitation of <i>Don Quijote</i>: <i>Un Don Quichotte moderne</i>
(1712).<a class="ref" id="ref66.2" href="#note66.2">2</a>
[The plot is as follows:]
<span class="synopsis">The gentleman Pharsamon, who spends his days dreaming
over countless chivalric books with his aged uncle, finally so fuddles his head that
he does nothing but fantasize about supernatural heroisms, torments, tortures,
and other such outrages. So it happens that his heart also
becomes confused; he selects Cidalise as his impossible Dulcinea,
lets slip the sweet Clorine, and finally is captured by
a mature widow.</span>

<p>Another imitation of <i>Don Quijote</i> is found within Marivaux’s
story <i>La voiture embourbée</i> (1714), a sort of Decameron.
A party of stranded travelers, among them a lady steeped
in the heroic-gallant novel’s modes of thought and speech
improvises to pass the time a novel: <i>Le Roman
impromptu, ou les aventures du fameux Amandor et de la belle et
intrépide Ariobarzane</i> [“The impromptu story, or, the adventures
of the famous Amandor and the beautiful and intrepid Ariobarzane”].
The heroes — Amandor the male and Félicie-Ariobarzane the female Don Quixote —
perform a self-denying act of love,
crazed by novels such as [Scudéry’s <i>Artamène, ou</i>] <i>Le grand Cyrus</i>
and [La Calprenède’s] <i>Cléopâtre</i>. At their side are Pierrot, the image of Sancho, and
the chambermaid Perette, a female Sancho. This pairwise
grouping results in parallel scenes, as can also be found in Molière’s
<i>Dépit amoureux</i>. The two Don Quixotes set off on a journey.
Félicie has a dream adventure in a cave. A farcical
conclusion in a farmhouse unites the lovers in earthly love.

<p>Somewhat similar to Wieland’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Ta47AAAAcAAJ/page/n17"><i>Don Sylvio de Rosalva</i></a> (1764) is
Jacques Cazotte’s novella <a href="https://archive.org/details/oeuvresbadinese00cazogoog/page/n171"><i>La belle par accident</i></a> (1742):
<span class="synopsis">Prince Kalibad, crazed
by his reading of fairy tales, wants only to marry a fairy; etc.</span>

<p>Thus have authors sought to mock with Don-Quixotery in turn
the chivalric novel, the pastoral novel,
<a id="p67"><span class="pagenum">p67</span></a>
the heroic-gallant novel, and the fairy tale.
The conceit of the “overexcited reader” has become the
traditional vehicle for satire against the writing of fantastical stories.

<p class="blank"><a id="IIp6"><b>VI.</b></a>&nbsp;
After the detailed treatment that we have given to
Lesage’s work, it might easily seem as if
we were giving it more importance than it deserves,
when in fact for Lesage’s artistic development it signified
little more than a stylistic exercise — and for the novelistic form itself,
since nobody was influenced by it, it signified nothing at all.
Nevertheless, the book cannot be omitted from the general context of
the development of literature. For, on the one hand, we
recognise in it the conventional strokes characteristic of a beginner alongside the
original style of the later master of the moral novel;
on the other hand, according to the law of supply and demand,
which even in literature applies to a certain extent,
Lesage would hardly have thrown his <i>Don Quichotte</i> onto the market
if he had not expected a suitable public.

<p>Indeed, the interest in Cervantes’ <i>Don Quijote</i>, which had
lasted through the whole 17th century, even in Lesage’s time
had barely cooled. This is demonstrated by the imitations mentioned in the
preceding chapter, and by the appearance of numerous
<span class="unclear" title="Übertragungen">translations</span>
and new editions of earlier
translations at the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century.
The ground in France, for the reception
of a <i>Don Quijote</i>, was extraordinarily favorable. The tendency towards mockery
so inheres in the French national character that one might almost
wonder that the Gallic wit has produced nothing equal to it.
Even in the Middle Ages, the chivalric epic poems were travestied
in poems such as <i>Audigier</i>.<a class="ref" id="ref67.1" href="#note67.1">1</a>
Rabelais’ <i>Gargantua and Pantagruel</i>, too, is basically a parody
of the chivalric romance.<a class="ref" id="ref67.2" href="#note67.2">2</a>

<p>If nonetheless the <i>Don Quijote</i> did not have the
practical effect in France that it did in Spain, the reason for this lies
in another aspect of the French national character. The
<i>esprit gaulois</i>, which wants to be free and unfettered, does not
disdain the ugly, and grinds the beautiful into the dust, is joined by an enthusiasm
<a id="p68"><span class="pagenum">p68</span></a>
for the sublime and a sense for formal beauty. The two sides are not
mutually exclusive: they coexist, conflict, and yet stand multiply
interrelated. Through the whole of French literature
one can see traces of this doubleness. Often it coincides with
the opposition between aristocracy and democracy, as in the
Middle Ages with the opposition between the courtly and the popular. But nowhere
is it more evident than in the 17th-century novel.
On the one hand, there are the works of the <i>esprit précieux</i>, the novels
of Gomberville, La Calprenède, and Scudéry, and on the other hand,
the bourgeois novel with satirical tendencies of Sorel, Scarron, and
Furetière. This opposition in novel-writing is concerned only with the
material itself, not with the structuring of the material. In both camps
prevails the same freedom of composition. It is as if the poets,
constrained by the three unities in drama, in the novel aimed to compensate
by utter indifference to those unities. Lesage, too, remains under the spell of this
novelistic technique.
So it is that Lesage took Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i>,
which was well composed in itself, and with heterogeneous insertions so
tore it apart that in his adaptation it appears unfinished
and disunified.

<p>But he also demonstrates the innovations brought about by the triumph
of realism. The ever-waxing historical sensibility,
the desire for historical verity even in poetical
depictions of events, had in the last decades of the 17th century
birthed a new genre, the autobiographical novel,
which, while retaining many traditional features, outwardly resembled
the then so popular memoir literature, with its title words
<i>Mémoires</i>, <i>Annales</i>, <i>Histoires véritables</i>, etc. There was also an interest
in psychological analysis, which we find perfectly formed in Mme de La&nbsp;Fayette’s
<i>Princesse de Clèves</i> (1678)
and in La&nbsp;Bruyère’s <i>Caractères</i> (1688).

<p>Although the characterization in the original episodes of the
work we are considering leaves much to be desired, there is,
on the other hand, in the treatment of the historical background a
significant advance. If we suppose the problem of the historical
novel to be the extracting from the historical mass of the
fate of a single man, and the depicting of his part in events
and of their influence on him, we must admit that
Lesage, in the history of young Don Fernando de
<a id="p69"><span class="pagenum">p69</span></a>
Peralta, has solved this problem in a satisfactory manner. The remove from
historical truth demanded by poetic liberty is
eased by the fact that the hero, who stands at the center of the action,
is not any of those great movers of world history whose biography,
in its main features and even in many details,
is familiar to the great mass of readers.

<p>In short, Lesage’s adaptation of Avellaneda’s <i>Don Quijote</i>
is in language and in content superior to its model, but in composition
unsuccessful. The parts which are original announce already the author of the
<i>Diable Boiteux</i> and <i>Gil Blas</i>. One would therefore do well
to give the author’s first work the place in his oeuvre
it has, until now, been denied.

<p>The title <i>Vida y hechos</i> has been customary since the Brussels edition of <i>D. Q.</i> (1662

(pages <a href="https://archive.org/details/theatrohespaol05garcuoft/page/viii"><span class="sc">vii–ix</span></a>,
reports a similar case.
At a performance of Pedro Calderón’s <i>La niña de Gómez Arias</i>, the
Alcaldes of Court, who were in charge of the theater, had taken their place
on the stage and were accompanied by some <i>alguaciles</i> [bailiffs]. In the scene
where Gómez Arias wants to sell to the Moors the unfortunate girl
he has seduced, one of the <i>alguaciles</i> was so carried away by the lively

who denies the Spaniards any acquaintance with the grotesque style,
even clearer is the grotesque description in Luis Vélez de Guevara’s <i>Diablo cojuelo</i> (1641),

“But who is that blotchy one in a blouse, who finds not only
the bed too small, but also the house and all Madrid; who in snoring makes more noise than
Bermuda; and, it seems, drinks toasts by the vat and eats <i>gigote</i> [chopped meat] by the vault?

It is a pity that the third volume of Leopoldo Rius’ <i>Bibliografía crítica</i> (1905)
[sections <a href="https://archive.org/details/bibliografiacrit0000rius/page/15">8</a>
and <a href="https://archive.org/details/bibliografiacrit0000rius/page/189">9</a>],
dealing with “Judgments on Cervantes,”
gives of its attention too much to the panegyrics and too little to the critics.
In it we find neither Sorel nor Lesage.

character say whatever is proper, effective, and good in each particular place,
without troubling himself to calculate whether these words may, perhaps,
fall into apparent contradiction with some other passage.”

The “female Don Quixote” can be found yet elsewhere in literature.
In Adrien-Thomas Perdon de Subligny,
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=U8E5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PP7"><i>La Fausse Clélie</i></a>
(1670, 1671, 1680, 1712, 1718) the heroine goes crazy while reading the whole 8000-page
<i>Histoire Romaine</i>. Cf. Körting, <i>op. cit.</i> volume&nbsp;II,
<a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UpIZAAAAYAAJ/page/n287">page&nbsp;273</a>.

The novel <i>The Female Quixote</i>, by Charlotte Lennox (1752), is a satire on
Scudéry’s novels. The heroine Arabella, a noblewoman by birth, endowed with amiable qualities,
but who, because her father brought her up in complete isolation from the world and
because she constantly read Scudéry’s novels, finally takes the
events of these poems as true and arranges her behavior accordingly.
She imagines that every man is in love with her, and lives in constant fear
of being abducted. She takes her father’s gardener for a disguised prince,
and dismisses a sensible lover because he is insufficiently versed in the code
of heroic gallantry.
Cf. Dunlop, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_3kRKAAAAcAAJ/page/n316">page 312</a>
(in Liebrecht’s German translation, <a href="https://archive.org/details/geschichtederpro00dunl/page/334">page 334</a>).
Lucia, the confidante corresponding to Sancho Panza, has none of
her counterpart’s comical aspects.

<p>This novel was translated into French in 1773, into German in 1754,
and into Spanish in 1808. See Rius, <i>op. cit.</i> volume II,
<a href="https://archive.org/details/bibliografiacrit02ruis/page/304">page&nbsp;304</a>.
