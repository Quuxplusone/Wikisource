<p>This is John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Wolf</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The text is taken from a typescript whose original (with penciled
additions presumably by Sousa) is in the
Library of Congress's Sousa collection (ML31.S68 box 32 folder 4), although
I used a photocopy from the Paul Bierley papers in the Sousa Archives at UIUC (box 79 folder 5),
which additionally contains blue-pen notes by Bierley.
Some manuscript lyric fragments, with score, are found in ML31.S68 box 32 folder 5;
these include “I’m a Photographer” (song, Binks), ”The Duchess comes / When hearts want other hearts”
(Binks and Loba), and fragments of “I ask your most profound attention” (Wolf)
and “If I’m forced to wed you” (Mariquita and Lombriz).


<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated

<center><h2>Act I</h2></center>


<p><span class="sc">Scene.—</span><i>A Spanish village in the Pyrenees.
Villa of Mariquita <span class="sd">R.</span> with trellised veranda.
A public inn, the “Golden Donkey,” <span class="sd">L.</span>
At back a stone fence with gate in center; streets.
As curtain rises, groups of villagers are discovered making floral letters,
forming the words “Mariquita weds this day,” which they place on the side
of the trellis.</i>

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Chorus</p>
<p> May and December are to mate,
 Beauty and Gold will link their fate;
 Though Mariquita weds this day,
 Grief in her youthful heart has sway.
 For neighbors say—and who so wise
 With gossips’ tongues and prying eyes?—
 Though old Lombriz may claim her hand,
 Her heart’s another’s to command.
<p><span class="left sc">Men</span> &emsp; There’s myst’ry here,
<span class="left sc">Girls</span> And that’s what we can’t discover.
<span class="left sc">Men</span> &emsp; It’s very queer
<span class="left sc">Girls</span> That she should wed an antique lover.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> For Mariquita surely knows
 &emsp; The power of beauty to enthrall,
 And she could have unnumbered beaux,
 &emsp; As she is idolized by all.
</div>

<p>[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Villette</span>.</i>]

<div class="song">
<p><span class="left sc">Vil.</span> How sad is Mariquita’s fate:
 To wed a man she can but hate.

 Or rather by the codicil,
 She’s forced to wed the miser old
 Or lose her father’s hoards of gold.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> The inside facts we’d like to know—
 Why did her father treat her so?
</div>

<div class="song">
<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Villette</span></p>
<p> When Mariquita made her bow,
 Her coming caused a fam’ly row.
 Her father counted on a boy
 To be his future hope and joy.
 In punishment for her neglect
 He left a will to this effect:
<span class="unclear" title="These two lines in pencil. Typed: “Before her eighteenth year had flown, / Lombriz might claim her for his own.”">When eighteen years has spanned her life,</span>
Lombriz may claim her for his wife.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> Suppose she dare refuse to wed?
<p><span class="left sc">Vil.</span> Why, if she dare refuse to wed
 &emsp; The vast domain
 &emsp; She can’t retain—
 Lombriz gets all instead.
<p> If old Lombriz decline to wed,
 The fortune goes to her instead.
 But he wants Mariquita’s gold.
 Besides, her charms are manifold.
<p> Both gold and charms she’d like to save
 And jilt this antiquated knave;
 And though the nuptial time is set,
 She’ll find a way to cheat him yet.
<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> It’s our belief she’ll cheat him yet.
<p><span class="left sc">Vil.</span> And all her schemes I will abet;
 &emsp; When women say
 &emsp; They’ll have their way,
<span class="left sc">All</span> They’ll have it, don’t forget!

<p> How sad to dream of some ancestral sire
 &emsp; Who lived in those old days of bliss,
 When noble hearts beat under grand attire
 &emsp; And coats were sumptuous as this.
 Then each man was a noble cavalier
 &emsp; On whom fair maidens loved to smile
 In that aristocratic atmosphere,
 &emsp; When this old coat was in the style.
<p> Excuse me if I shed a mournful tear
 &emsp; For those lost days of raiment rare;
 My great-great-uncle left this souvenir
 &emsp; For me to weep about and wear.
 And when I gaze around this modern throng,
 &emsp; At your bad taste I fain would smile;
 But taste in dress, my friends, was never wrong
 &emsp; When this old coat was in the style.

<p>[<i>Exeunt hurriedly, <span class="sd">U. E. L.</span> As they go off,
enter the <span class="sc">Notary</span>; he engages in conversation
with <span class="sc">Villette</span>.</i>]

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
Are you sure you are not mistaken?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Not in the least. I read the will to-day, for the four hundred and
eleventh time, searching for the inevitable flaw. I found it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
The flaw?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
The inevitable flaw.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
It wasn’t in the sealing, was it?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
The will explicitly says that Donna Mariquita must be wed to
Lombriz—you understand, must be wed to Lombriz—<em>before her
eighteenth year.</em> There is no provision for any subsequent
period.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
There is no need of any, as Lombriz has named to-night for the wedding.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
But if he should fail to appear—?

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
What, you don’t mean cold poison!

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Nonsense. Suppose some trusted friend of Mariquita’s should conclude
that a change of air would be beneficial to Lombriz.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
In other words, kidnap him.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
I would call it a surprise party.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
A masquerade would sound better.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
And make it so pleasant for him that he couldn’t tear himself away.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
Well, it wouldn’t work.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Why not?

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
Do you imagine Lombriz would submit to such a trick without showing up
the culprits?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
That’s it exactly.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
I don’t understand.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Briefly, then, he returns. Donna Mariquita in the mean time has married.
Lombriz is furious. He invokes the power of the law—

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
And sues for the estate.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Donna Mariquita appoints me her attorney—

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
In which case we lose.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Exactly. I appeal to a higher court—

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
And we lose again.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Yes, but only after a long fight and many postponements.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
And then?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
I appeal to the Supreme Court.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
What of that?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
What of that? Why, before it reaches trial, Donna Mariquita will be
a grandmother, and Lombriz will be tucked away under the daisies.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
But who will have the fortune?

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Well, that depends; but I feel confident Lombriz won’t.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
I’ll tell Donna Mariquita of your plan; maybe she’ll adopt it, as she
is almost distracted at the thought that she may be forced to marry
that miserable old miser.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Say to her I suggested it out of pure disinterested friendship.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
No doubt she’ll appreciate it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
And say when she sends over a check in the morning to be sure
and write the figures plainly. The banks are so
<span class="unclear" title="32/4 has “peculiar”">particular</span>.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
Now I know it is disinterested friendship with a string to it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Not.</span>
Remember, I enjoin absolute secrecy.

<p><span class="sc dr">Vil.</span>
I’ll run and tell Mariquita and the rest of the girls.
It will be awfully jolly.

 This fact I pray you understand,

<p> To marry or not to marry—
 &emsp; That’s the interrogation:
 Whether a husband will be to me
 &emsp; A joy or complication.
 I’m really so much in doubt.
 The answer I can’t study out.
 I’ll waste no time in fancies,
 &emsp; But I’ll invoke the mystic aid
 &emsp; Of diamond, club, and heart, and spade,
 And to them trust my chances.
<p> Here’s a pack
 Of red and black,
 &emsp; Spots and faces,
 &emsp; Deuces, aces,
 Each suit with its jack.
 Cut and deal
 Will soon reveal
 &emsp; If I’ll marry
 &emsp; Or yet tarry
 In lone woe or weal.
<p> &emsp; The first is red—
 &emsp; Am I to wed
 Auburn locks with tinge of gold?
 &emsp; A stranger now,
 &emsp; With lordly brow,
 And graces grand and manifold?
<p> What’s this I see?—
 A captive he!
 &emsp; I must find him,
 &emsp; And remind him
 He belongs to me.
<p> <span class="unclear" title="32/4 clearly types “Lie”; but 32/5 had penned what might plausibly be “See.” “Lie” is plausible if Loba is addressing a queen she’s just revealed.">Lie</span> you there,
 O woman fair!
 &emsp; Though your tresses
 &emsp; And caresses
 Are beyond compare,
 Woe to you—
 To hope adieu—
 &emsp; Though he wooed you
 &emsp; And pursued you,
 He’s my lover true.
 &emsp; If you dare
 &emsp; His heart to share
 &emsp; Oh, then beware!
 &emsp; Take care, take care!
 For the silent cards decree
 He is ev’rything to me.
<p> Sweetheart unknown,
 My destined own,
 &emsp; Meditating,
 &emsp; Weary, waiting,
 I am here alone.
 The golden red
 That tops your head
 &emsp; Will help me trace you,
 &emsp; Hunt you, chase you,
 For I must be wed.

How did you know I was here?

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
Last night, I disguised myself as old Lombriz.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
As old Lombriz? And you were—

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
Attacked by robbers.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
I mean I was one of the robbers!

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
You—! Why, it was given out this morning that you were abducted.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
Nonsense. We abducted Lombriz.

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
THen you were with the robbers, who—

Continue your narrative. <span class="unclear" title="Penciled over “Who started the story that I was abducted?” in 32/4">Do the villagers believe that I was abducted?</span>

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
Yes. A letter was received by the Alcalde, stating that just before the hour set for your
marriage, you, by accident, discovered Lombriz in close consultation with two robbers
named Gandul and Sapo.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
Why, they are members of this band!

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
And, continued the letter, your unwilling ears and outraged feelings learned for the first
time that Lombriz was a villain of the deepest dye.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
What a fabrication!

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
The letter furthermore said that you immediately determined to reveal his true character
to the Alcalde. You were about to leave the house, when Lombriz, knowing that exposure
would be fatal to him, by the aid of those two robbers abducted and forced you to marry
him.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
Quite ingenious. But surely no one believes this story?

<p><span class="sc dr">Gab.</span>
No one? Every one! Lombriz is cordially hated by all; consequently, everybody believes it.

<p><span class="sc dr">Mar.</span>
Come, I’ll tell you my plan and introduce you to the band. They are going to crown a new
king to-day. We’ll witness the ceremony, and then—

<p> Hope only flies when Love itself is dead.
 Love only dies when Hope, dismayed, has fled.
 &emsp; Oh, lover tried and true,
 &emsp; This world so old is new,
 For Cupid whispers to me we shall wed.
<p> Tears no longer flowing,
 &emsp; Let peace alone
 &emsp; Our future own.
 With bliss my heart is glowing.
 &emsp; The night is past;
 &emsp; Day comes at last.

their carbines, sit down and go to sleep. Finally a
portion of the wall falls out, and <span class="sc">Binks</span> pokes his

<p class="who">Trio—<span class="sc">Binks</span>, <span class="sc">Gandul</span>, and <span class="sc">Sapo</span>
<p><span class="left sc">Binks</span> A bird reduced to feather-weight
 &emsp; Shivers on a leafless shrub
 Preparing to annihilate
 &emsp; A rather Lilliputian grub.
 You or I perhaps would growl,
 Yet this optimistic fowl
 Is a stranger to a scowl—
 &emsp; And why, say, why?
<p><span class="left sc">Sapo</span> By “why, say, why?”
 Do you mean to imply
 &emsp; My views may now be heard?—
<p><span class="left sc">Gan.</span> Well, I should think
 This bobolink
 &emsp; (If he’s that kind of bird)
 Would slap his downy chest
 And chirp a joyful jest
 &emsp; Because he’s free
 &emsp; To pick the tree
 On which to build his nest.
<p><span class="left sc">Binks</span> Consequently,
<span class="left sc">Gan.</span> &emsp; Consequently,

 Let’s fly without delay
 Where the merry fountains play.
 And if we cannot find
 A fountain of that kind,
 &emsp; We’ll lose no rest
 &emsp; In useless quest
 But try to be resigned.
<p> The customary time
 For gentlemen of crime
 To softly steal away
 Is never at midday;
 &emsp; But duty calls,
 &emsp; And, while it galls,
 We can no longer stay.
<p><span class="left sc">Binks</span> Why, with listless apathy,
 &emsp; Does the birdling in his cage
 Sadly chirp a threnody?
 &emsp; Does he thus his grief assuage?
 Though from gun and hawk he’s free,
 Still in actuality
 A chronic pessimist is he—
 &emsp; And why, say, why?
<p><span class="left sc">Sapo</span> By “why, say, why?”
 Do you mean to imply
 &emsp; My views may now be heard?—
<p><span class="left sc">Gan.</span> Well, I should say
 This gloomy jay
 &emsp; (If he’s that kind of bird)
 Is sad and much oppress’d,
 And would prefer to rest
 &emsp; Where freedom shrieks
 &emsp; On lofty peaks
 And thereon build his nest.
<p><span class="left sc">Binks</span> Consequently,
<span class="left sc">Gan.</span> &emsp; Consequently,
<span class="left sc">Sapo</span> &emsp; &emsp; Consequently,

 Let’s fly without delay, etc.
<p> The customary time
 For gentlemen of crime
 To softly steal away
 Is never at midday;
 &emsp; But in this case
 &emsp; It’s no disgrace
 If we great haste display.
