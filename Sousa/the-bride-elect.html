<p>This is John Philip Sousa’s comic operetta <i>The Bride Elect</i>,
transcribed and edited by Arthur O’Dwyer (2025).
<p>The lyrics are mostly as they appear in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/bride-elect-ml50s719b7">the libretto</a>
printed by the John Church Company in 1897, a copy of which resides in the Library of Congress
(call number ML50.S719.B7.1897).
More detailed parts are found in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uKoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1">the
piano/vocal score</a> published by John Church Co. (1897). Neither of these sources
provides dialogue or stage directions; I lack a (public-domain) source for those.

<p>Many small corrections, especially to punctuation, have been made quietly.
Larger corrections, issues, and notes are marked in the text
<span class="unclear" title="This is the mouseover text">like this</span>,
with further details in the mouseover text.

<p>The typographical presentation is inspired by
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Asimov’s Annotated
Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a> (1988).

<p><span class="sc">Scene.—</span><i>A street in the Isle of Capri.</i>

<p class="who">Chorus
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> If ninety-nine percent <span class="unclear" title="These words present in B7 but absent from p/v">of what</span> the papers print is so
 (And many editors regard the figure low),
 Then we have ample reason to expect today
 King Papagallo, who is coming, so they say,
 To claim the Princess Minutezza’s hand;
 But why he should, we cannot understand.
 &emsp; He’s much too old for her,
 &emsp; In this we all concur,
 Her heart he never can command.
<p><span class="left sc">Men</span> &emsp; &emsp; The papers say
<span class="left sc">Girls</span> &emsp; His coming is quite unexpected;
<span class="left sc">Men</span> &emsp; &emsp; And trust he may
<span class="left sc">Girls</span> &emsp; By Minutezza be rejected.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> If Papagallo’s very wise,
 &emsp; He’ll woo the mother, not the maid.
 As wife the Queen might prove a prize;
 &emsp; As ma-in-law, an awful jade.
<p> When polity and state affairs are paramount,
 “Vox Populi” and “Constant Reader” do not count;
 Therefore we will not send a protest to the press,
 But wish the couple sev’ral kinds of happiness;
 And should they ask us all to come and dine,
 We do not feel that we could well decline;
 &emsp; For gastronomic bliss
 &emsp; Has never been amiss,
 When coupled with a little wine.

<p><span class="left sc">Bia.</span> The morning news we see you’re reading,

<p><span class="left sc">Chorus</span> The inside facts we’d like to know:
 Why must she wed our hated foe?

<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Oh, sorrow!
<p><span class="left sc">Bia.</span> We wrote a letter full of sad regrets,
 But his reply was couched in awful threats.
 &emsp; So we said we’d go to war,
 &emsp; With all its glory and its gore,
 And settle thus our diff’rences and debts.
<p> With clanking sword and glist’ning gun
 &emsp; He marched in exultation,
 &emsp; Free from fear and trepidation,
 &emsp; And his men’s vociferation
 &emsp; Was too much for contemplation—
 We were forced to run.

<p><span class="left sc">Bia.</span> We met the enemy and we were theirs!
<span class="left sc">Chorus</span> &emsp; &emsp; Oh, sorrow!

<p class="who">Song—<span class="sc">Papagallo</span>
<p><span class="left sc">Pap.</span> I know a goat, a little goat, who loves to cut a dash.
 &emsp; He goes about from morn to night,
 &emsp; And his particular delight
 &emsp; Is to get mixed up in a fight
 And his opponent thrash.
 &emsp; While going out <span class="unclear" title="Thus in p/v; omitted from B7">to dine</span> one day,
 &emsp; He chanced to stop upon his way
 &emsp; And listened to a <em>something</em> play
 They call a phonograph.
<p><span class="left"><span class="sc">All</span> [<i>imitating the phonograph’s tune</i>]</span>
 Br—! br—! br—!
<p><span class="left sc">Pap.</span> The phonograph struck up a tune that seemed to please the goat.
 &emsp; He heard it fifty times at least,
 &emsp; And when the phonograph had ceased
 &emsp; This unmelodic little beast
 Could not recall a note.
 &emsp; His eyes flashed fire—his anger rose—
 &emsp; And then he raised up on his toes,
 &emsp; And at the silent box he goes
 With all his might and main.
<p><span class="left sc">All</span> Br—! br—! br—!
<p><span class="left sc">Pap.</span> He smashed the phonograph to bits and kicked it all to pot;
 &emsp; The cylinders of wax he ate;
 &emsp; And then without a moment’s wait
 &emsp; He swallowed, I am pained to state,
 The nickels in the slot.
 &emsp; And from that time unto this day
 &emsp; The chewed-up records with him stay
 &emsp; And in his bosom softly play
 The tune he could not catch.

<p><span class="left sc">Past.</span> &emsp; The God of Love presides;
 So ring the wedding bells in joyful measure
 &emsp; For the grooms and brides,
 And let us hope that each has found a treasure.
 Love knows no disaster—
 &emsp; &emsp; Woo him,
 &emsp; &emsp; Sue him,
 Cupid as our master
 &emsp; Fore’er abides.
<p> &emsp; So call the parson in!
 It’s very pleasant when true hearts are mated,
 &emsp; But it is a sin
 To join a maid and man who start ill-fated.
 Oh the sweet tomorrow—
 &emsp; &emsp; Wooing,
 &emsp; &emsp; Cooing—
 For we’ll banish sorrow
 &emsp; And let love win.
