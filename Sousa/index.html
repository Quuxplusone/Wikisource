<h2 style="padding-top: 60px;">The operettas of John Philip Sousa</h2>

<p>The comic operas of John Philip Sousa, edited (lightly redacted and reconstructed) and lightly annotated
by Arthur O’Dwyer. If there’s no link for a particular operetta below, it means that either I’m having trouble
finding the book, or I’ve been too lazy to go look for it thus far. If you can help, please
<a href="mailto:arthur.j.odwyer@gmail.com">send me an email!</a>

<p>Eventually, if I collect a critical mass of these operettas, I will be very interested in publishing a book
containing my own full annotations of all of them — annotations explaining
why a vinaigrette might contain ammonium carbonate (<i>The Queen of Hearts</i>),
what kind of dance is the Aragonese Jota (<i>The Wolf</i>),
why 2:05¼ was a good “gait” for a revolution (<i>El Capitan</i>),
why one’s neighbors might drink Moxie to deal with late-night trumpet practice (<i>The Free Lance</i>),
and so on — in the style of Isaac Asimov’s
<a href="https://archive.org/details/asimovsannotated00sull/"><i>Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan</i></a>.
If you have the publishing connections to make that happen, please again

<p>With Sousa, different researchers have different interests, and some aspects of these operettas are “more lost” than others:
<ul>
  <li>The <i>piano/vocal score</i> often survives; this consists of lyrics and a piano arrangement of the music.</li>
  <li>Sousa, the March King, would generally produce a <i>march</i> on themes from the operetta; so there exist marches for
    <a href="https://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/El-Capitan-March/"><i>El Capitan</i></a>,
    <a href="https://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/The-Bride-Elect-March/"><i>The Bride-Elect</i></a>,
    <a href="https://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/The-Charlatan-March/"><i>The Charlatan</i></a>,
    and <a href="https://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/The-Free-Lance-March/"><i>The Free Lance</i></a>.
    (And for G&amp;S’s <a href="https://www.marineband.marines.mil/Audio-Resources/The-Complete-Marches-of-John-Philip-Sousa/Mikado-March/"><i>The Mikado!</i></a>)
    Full orchestral arrangements of all these marches are downloadable from the Marine Band’s website.</li>
  <li>The <i>orchestral arrangement</i> of the operetta’s music (including incidental music) is often lost,
    but there seems to be a cottage industry of musicologists willing to reconstruct it from the piano arrangement and march.
    See for example Lisa Keeney’s <a href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&context=sss">“Creating a Modern Performance Edition of Sousa Operetta”</a> (2013),
    on <i>The Bride-Elect</i>.</li>
  <li>The <i>book</i>, meaning the dialogue that tells the plot between the songs, is often lost. This is the part
    that most interests me.</li>
  <li>The <i>production notes</i> for a given production include detailed stage directions and blocking,
    a list of properties, notes on costuming, and so on, for use by the director.
    A <i>promptbook</i> is a copy of the <i>book and lyrics</i> with these detailed stage directions and blocking
    included.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note (and I myself likely haven’t properly internalized) that these works don’t necessarily have any “correct” or even
“canonical” form. Tracey Chessum <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/09/30/musical-month-flexible-operetta-and-micro-history-guest-blogger-tracey-chessum">wrote</a> in 2011:
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals producing and performing Sousa’s comic operas around the turn of the 20th century continually re-wrote his texts —
swapping songs from previous operas by Sousa and other composers, including dialogue from other shows and other poetic interpolations,
often until nothing but Sousa’s name survived [...] This constant re-writing made his scripts extremely difficult to return to any
definitive form. As we have seen from the transcription, a good portion of the music contained within <i>The Charlatan</i>’s piano/vocal
score was no longer in use by the time the show was produced in London. However, evidence suggests that this was not an anomaly.
There was no definitive form of the operettas of this time period — they were meant to be constantly in flux, changing with audience
taste, performer and creator agendas, and national and/or regional sentiments.
</blockquote>

<hr width="20%" style="margin: 60px;"/>

<p>The <a href="https://comicoperaguild.org/recordings/">Comic Opera Guild</a> in Ann Arbor, Michigan, offers audio recordings of
<i>El Capitan</i>, <i>The Bride-Elect</i>, <i>The Charlatan</i>, <i>Chris and the Wonderful Lamp</i>, and <i>The Free Lance</i>,
all with dialogue reconstructed and/or edited by Tom Petiet.

<p>Jerrold Fisher and William Martin (both now deceased, as far as I can tell),
operating as Lyric Theatre International,
”restored, edited, and elaborated“ at least <i>Désirée</i>, <i>El Capitan</i>,
<i>The Charlatan</i>, and <i>Chris and the Wonderful Lamp</i>;
although it is unclear to me how much of Martin’s libretto would have been mere <em>editing</em>
and how much <em>elaboration</em>. As a reader, not a producer, the former interests me
and the latter does not. (The latter would also be copyright-encumbered.) See this passage from
<a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.american-music.org/resource/resmgr/docs/bulletin/volume_xxiv,_no._1_(spring_1.pdf">“Performances of Note,”</a>
<i>The Sonneck Society for American Music Bulletin</i> <b>24</b>:1 (Spring 1998), page 15, penned by Phyllis Danner—
<blockquote>
<p>Under the direction of Maestro Ian Hobson, the Sinfonia da Camera at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) presented the premiere of a
newly-restored concert version of John Philip Sousa’s most famous operetta,
<i>El Capitan</i>, on Saturday, 27 September [1997] at the Krannert Center for the
Performing Arts. Lyric Theatre International dramatist Dr. William A. Martin, Jr.
and musicologist Dr. Jerrold Fisher, who recently completed the restoration,
served as masters of ceremonies for the event along with Phyllis Danner,
archivist for the Sousa Archives for Band Research at UIUC.
<p>During a pre-concert lecture, Danner provided an overview of the UIUC
Sousa Collection and Martin and Fisher discussed their work over the past
13 years toward restoration of <i>El Capitan</i> (1895), as well as their
reconstruction of Sousa’s first operetta <i>Desiree</i> (1883), and of his
<i>Chris and the Wonderful Lamp</i> (1899). Although the libretto has been
lost, Martin and Fisher reconstructed the story line by consulting critical
reviews of the day, stage directions, and other primary resources, including
those held by the Sousa Archives for Band Research at UIUC.
<a href="https://amzn.to/43PC9um">A compact disc recording</a>
of the 27 September performance will be available commercially
in 1998. Fisher and Martin have recently released
<a href="https://amzn.to/3DI8UiF">an AMDEC CD</a> of a performance
of <i>Desiree</i> by the Pocono Pops Orchestra and Chorus. [...]
</blockquote>
And this from
<a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/09/16/musical-month-sousas-charlatan-guest-blogger">Tracey Chessum</a> in 2011:
<blockquote>
<p>A “playable” reconstruction of the libretto [of <i>The Charlatan</i>] was done in the 1980s by musicologists William Martin
and Jerrold Fisher, in conjunction with the Sousa family. These have not been commercially published,
but there is a copy of this finished libretto at the Sousa Archives and Center for American Music
at the University of Illinois. The Martin/Fisher libretto is based around the original published
piano/vocal score, and does not take into account any of the departures from the original material
from the New York, Touring, or London production runs.  Additionally, as with many reconstructions,
Martin and Fisher were forced to make choices of their own when sufficient information was not
available to fill in the comedic details, or to make the work accessible to modern audiences.
I have compared the London production libretto to the reconstructed libretto, and while the book
and dialogue are nearly identical, the reconstructed libretto is far more polished. Where the
London script often shortens situational comic moments to <i>BUS</i> (or comic BUSiness), the
polished [Martin &amp; Fisher] score flushes them out.
</blockquote>

<p>Jerrold Fisher also worked on <i>The Glass-Blowers</i>, which was staged by
<a href="https://www.christopheralden.net/Glassblowers.htm">Christopher Alden</a> in 2000 and 2002.
It’s unclear to me whether that production included dialogue.

<p>Theatre Arts Press (TAP) has published a “Historical Libretto Series” including three Sousa operettas:
<a href="https://www.musical-librettos.com/the-charlatan-musical"><i>The Charlatan</i></a> (2015, ISBN 1522947361),
<a href="https://www.musical-librettos.com/el-capitan-musical"><i>El Capitan</i></a> (2021, ISBN 979-8595589260), and
<a href="https://www.musical-librettos.com/chris-wonderful-lamp"><i>Chris and the Wonderful Lamp</i></a> (2021, ISBN 979-8596398564).
I find their typography and spellchecking to be extremely poor, and they don’t indicate their sources.
I’ve since heard from TAP that their <i>El Capitan</i> was transcribed from one of the Harry Ransom Center’s sources below.
Its lyrics vary somewhat from both Jorgensen and the piano/vocal score.
TAP’s <i>Charlatan</i> is essentially identical to Tracey Chessum’s London version.
